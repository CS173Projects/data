Thank you for writing this review.

Not that I didn't think parts of it were fun for a bit, but the fun is just a veneer and wears thin quickly. The game is plagued by poor design, and none of the information provided to you is meaningful. The measurements for fleet strength are useless, the AI refuse to attack you unless they massively overpower you, and even then only attack stations and not outposts. The economy is terrible and wants you to grind for ages to get higher tier stuff, and any fleet ships that you have will die all the time, and they are super expensive. I quit playing because I had a fleet of 2 dreadnought's and 2 carriers parked at a station of 6 k fleetstrength lose an auto combat to a single cruiser. Just buggy and poorly thought out.

Edit - Since I have posted this review, they have released two patches that fix some of the bugs like single ships winning in auto combat against much larger forces. However, the game is in beta and the game mechanics are what they are. This game is not going to change drastically at least until an expansion. The enemy do not play on the same field as you, and as such you will feel like they are cheaters. I knocked the outlands down to a single planet, so they spawned a fleet of 17k power for HOURS. Every 2.5 minutes, or 1 week in game, a new hoard of ships to throw at my defenses. And if i lose 1 cruiser in that battle, it takes me longer to finance and build that ship, but guess what, they are back with 3 dreadnaughts and 2 carriers like that. So I fight them off for hours and save up 44k fleet power to assault their planet. Keep in mind at this point i have around 25 systems, and they are crammed into one. So I go assault the planet and they annihilate my force like it was nothing, then their 17k fleet immediately respawns and takes bases. The AI do not play on a fair field, and it makes everything in this game feel meaningless. I can understand the bugs, this is a Beta, but the game design is what it is. I did not expect a finished game, but a meaningful and fun one. Not one where every decision feels grind, unlikely to succeede, and meaningless.",1493173734,1493566927,False,5,0,0.4684909880161285,4,True,False,True,False,,1493187009.0,"Hi and apologies for intruding on your review like this.

Even though i am not a racer, i fly mostly freestyle, i really like this Sim. The maps are large and interesting and the occasional solo race is fun, too. It helped me get more confident with some tricks. To be honest, i still do not feel like i got a lot better with this because of the lack of real consequences. If i run my quad into a concrete wall in real life, it may break some stuff. If i hit some treetops a few hundred meters away, there is a chance i will never find my quad are all parts that flew off ;) In the Sim i fly a lot more risky. If something happens i just flip over or press the rest button.

I got stuck on one of the first missions because I didn't realize I was supposed to wait for an elevator because NPCs kept taking it before I even realized it was there. It's such a chore to wait for a single person massive elevator to slowly rise up just to take it slowly down again. This is 1000 years into the future, why don't we have Futurama passenger tubes yet? Or just make it so NPCs dont take elevators.

This idea is great. Right up my alley. Engineer/build things to achieve some goal(s). I really love this genre... but Nimbatus just can't pull it off for me. I want to like this game, but can't.

In the early stages of a creation I'm hopeful and excited with a thousand ideas spinning in my head... but after hours of work I always have to reduce it back so far that is underwhelms me. Kind of like a DM that doesn't let his/her players push the boundaries with creativity.

Ultimately, the part selection combined with the much-to-be-desired physics engine fall flat. Far too limiting.

The autonomous competition aspect of the game is really the only draw for me. The single player is quite boring.

Adopting a retro arcade 8-bit art style, the SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect, or Sword Justice Deluxe Selective Memory Erase Effect plays as a 2D platformer where you move your character, a mechanical android cat through different layers of fear clusters in order to reach an end terminal to log out and return to the real world where his link partner, M1Mi resides in.  Along the way, the cat meets many parts of the operating system that take a physical form as enemies.  In order to progress through the game, players must complete each level by moving their character from the left to the right; killing enemies along the way which will increase your score.  The developer has taken an extra step, whether intentional or not to bring the complete experience of a CRT arcade cabinet by featuring in-game screen brightness control for CRTs’, three button layouts found on cabinets and of course, infinite continues.

[h1] The Good	[/h1]

SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect follows true to the standard cabinet platformer.  To give an idea of how the game is like, think of the original metal slug, except your default weapon is a blade instead of a pistol.  Jumping, ducking, dodging, button mashing all the good mechanical components of cabinet games are retained in SWR JST DX SMEE and mesh really well to play a fun to play game.

SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect’s visuals are extremely well done.  For a game with only 256 different shades of colours to work with, this game manages to bring colourful visuals with unique background design for every chapter.  Although enemy mechanics and attack patterns were used in more than one type of enemy, each chapter of the game introduced new and special looking sprites for all the enemies.  

The difficulty of the game increases at a reasonable rate.  The first few chapters introduce players to the mechanics, and slowly become more demanding, such as throwing daggers while dodging and immediately air strafing in the opposite direction to slash an incoming enemy.  

The plot is based off of a good concept which actually revolves around an inner conflict that appears within the player. Taking a step back, you can see there are two sides of the story.  One of which is really evident to the player, the cat’s drive to log out of this nightmare and return to M1Mi.  But in order to reach the terminal, all the operating system enemies’ have everything that they longed for destroyed.  Looking back into the dialogue between the main characters, reveals that the main antagonist isn’t even truly evil, but just someone whose ideals sided with the OS components. 

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

Let’s start with the game itself.  Mentioned earlier, I’m not sure whether or not the developer decided to bring about the whole experience of old arcade games including the problems, or was just simply limited by the game engine they are working with.  Please note, at the time of writing this review, the game cannot save, meaning each time you start the game up, you have to start from the very beginning.  The argument may be that the game is short and can be completed in one sitting, but it is just a poor excuse that a save function not be implemented, if high scores can be recorded.  SWR JST DX SMEE also has problems shutting down properly.  The window may close, but it hangs on steam locking you in-game.  In order to play your other games again you have to shut down steam and restart the client.
 
Level design is not the best, and is very evident in the ice chapter where you utilize the same run and gun strategy.  Progression between levels can be spontaneous and abrupt with no warning narrative as seen by the mine cart stage. The result is a lot of gimmicky level designs that force you to lose a life no matter what, unless you’ve played through a second time.

The game itself is contradictory as to the scoring style.  2D side-scrolling platformer games like these usually are fast paced because they provide you with a ranged default weapon and unlimited ammunition.  Since SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect gives you a sword as a default weapon, you will often find yourself kiting backwards and staying just outside of the enemy hit range.  Anyone who has played a 2D side-scroller knows that going back the way you came from breaks the tempo of the game and since scoring is widely based off of number of enemies killed, you are forced to kill your enemies, making pacifist and speed runs totally redundant, not to mention impossible on some of the later levels. 

The plot itself is pretty shallow and leaves a lot to be desired.  Yes, the writer may have been going for a hero vs villain scenario, but nine lines of text between levels is not enough for the player to connect with the characters, leaving an empty and hollow characters.  It really is not enough for the player to judge the scenario correctly, and is hard to sympathize for the other cast of characters that are being antagonized. 

[h1] Overall Score [/h1]

As a complete package I rate Sword Justice Deluxe Selective Memory Erase Effect at 4/10.  This game is just too large of a hassle to get up and running and an even bigger annoyance when it comes to shutting down.   If you look at just the game, I would personally score this game at 6/10 just for the amazing visuals and good controls.  The reason it isn’t higher is because the game really falls short in terms of level design.

I did a few playthroughs with different races and it's clear that a lot of love went into this game. There are parts that definitely could've used more polish, but Salvation Prophecy is still an excellent mix of space combat and ground missions.

The game takes you between space and ground combat, both of which have offense and defense missions. There are primarily squad-based missions for the factions, but the main plot often has the player on a solo mission to explore a mysterious planet. There are also a chain of solo space missions for bounty-hunting. Later, as the player advances ranks within their faction, they can buy upgrades for their ship and eventually assume control of their faction. This lets the player order fleet and ground missions as well as build new buildings and space stations on conquered planets. 


[h1]Pros:[/h1]

--([b]Major[/b]) Space combat. While space stuff could be repetitive, it was overall very fun. The jump and wormhole mechanics made travel more interesting. It was an awesome feeling, being able to single-handedly take down an enemy capital ship and space station in the same mission once my squad had been killed.

--([b]Major[/b]) The ability to go from exploring my faction space station, jump in a ship, fly to another planet, land on it, meet new and interesting monsters, and kill them, in a 3rd person perspective. We seriously need more games like that.

--([b]Minor[/b]) Ship upgrades. I love games that let me upgrade vehicle stuff, and my only complaint here was that there weren't more choices or options. 

--([b]Minor[/b]) Some of the Salvation Prophecy storyline missions involve collecting runes with special powers that give the game a different twist beyond the usual sci-fi trope of simply getting bigger/better guns. Unleashing these runes on the very next ground mission was fun.

--([b]Minor[/b]) While all factions have mostly decent dialogue with occasional fun, the Wyr faction in particular has some great moments here.


[h1]Cons:[/h1]
--([b]Major[/b]) Ground combat. It often seemed a bit clunky and the races felt poorly balanced. For example in most ground missions, fighting the humans or killer robots was easy, but fighting against the blue all-female race that could steal life energy as a ranged attack was much harder (however [i]playing[/i] as the all-female race was a blast). 

--([b]Minor[/b]) Would've liked to see more mission types beyond a simple offense/defense on space and ground, and the bounty hunter chain. The prophecy plotline took care of this sometimes, but still could've used more variety in the faction missions.

--([b]Minor[/b]) The interior layout of the space stations was exactly the same across all factions. While the stuff inside the space station was somewhat different for each faction, it seemed a bit unrealistic that they'd all have the same map, with the exact same NPC jobs in each place. As such, once you know where your weapon vendor is for Race A, it will be in the exact same spot for the others. Definitely could have used more dev time to make the layouts feel unique to each faction.

--([b]Minor[/b]) Controls occasionally felt clunky. Worst was unstable wormholes, though maybe that was the entire point there.",1469671376,1469671591,True,5,0,0.5795397758483886,0,False,False,False,False,,,,248450

Wonky balance (Orc is a lot stronger than elf until you get the late game units upped dragon or wizard). No multiple upgrades for the same unit. No real point on the world map. Go buy SCII and play the gamemode there. This is barely even an alpha.

Grain of salt: Oculus Rift via Steam VR

-Does not look this good in-game due heavily to the FoV and resolution. The screenshots of the gameplay have significantly wider FoV; you will spend most of the time never seeing your hands.
-Hit-detection is a bit checkered too, and it's the first game other than Beat Saber to have issues with this for me. A recent update fixed Beat Saber though making it the only game that has hit-detection issues. Along with hit-detection issues, I noticed that the main menu would reset its position on me almost every minute. Knowing both issues could've been one-offs I rebooted my PC and continued having the issues both before and after playing other VR games.
-Music is okay-ish, and the graphics are noticeably bare basic Unity. Taskbar icon is the Unity logo, and the Unity splash screen is there so it's the free version. Looks, sounds, and feels like a cluster of Unity assets and public domain music, but for a $15.99 (on sale) try-&-refund I don't really feel it's my responsibility to check if it is just that. Even the game logo looks like a photoshop of some stock VR image I've seen before... But, again, that's not on me to check these things; it's on the developer to make the game look, sound, and feel like the experience is worth my time. Since I already have and enjoy Beat Saber and Box VR; it's not.

Addendum: Yes, I know it's in Early Access. Yes, I know it is still being developed. I'll check it out again at release, or after at least some significant improvements.

EDIT in response to Developer response:
Then key things to work on to make it not look like stock Unity assets:
1; Flesh out your normal maps. Give objects & environments some depth and smoothness instead of flat faceted polygonal early 2000's 3D.
2; Don't use what look like flame jpegs for the rays.
3; Pay for the Unity Engine so you can remove the stock Unity splash screen.

I hope what you claim about the artwork is true; there are many who gleefully investigate this sort of thing. I am not one of them. I made the statement solely for your benefit in case it was; they WILL find out.

Hit-detection may have been partially due to figuring out how reliable it even was, but I did feel I had reasonable straight punches on many targets that refused to connect. View centering did not occur during a round, but would happen every 30-60 seconds in the menu. I was streaming it at the time and can provide a link and time-stamp if you want evidence of this.
(EDIT2: Redacted link - expired VoD)

I'm not judging an entire game; that's on professional reviewers to do. I am critiquing my first impression; the part of the game that's supposed to impress your players and convince them the game is worth what they spent and their time to continue playing. This is my first impression; to try and invalidate that with a snide comment like that is not only insulting, it's arrogant. And the rest of your response oozes arrogance because of it. Don't be so conceited.",1562295701,1584159545,False,2,1,0.4126493632793426,7,True,False,True,False,,1562316404.0,"Sorry that you didn't like the game. But, we are still wondering how you can judge an entire game within 0.1h of playtime.

Nevertheless, we must reject your accusation that the game may consist of Unity assets and even the logo image may be made of stock art. Quite some time has been poured into that work, to make these models, these textures and graphics, so that our game does not only consist of simple glowing, non-textured models. By the way, the banner/logo image did take several hours of shooting that photo and making it look like that. So even that is not bought ;-).

Your issue with the main menu and the hit detection is weird and the first time we are hearing of that since a few updates. But, we are always keen to improve the game and take negative reviews seriously, when they describe a possible issue. So, maybe you can describe that in more detail. That would help us in improving the game.

One last comment: You are absolutely free to get a refund. There is no problem with that.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the performance and stability of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development from our two-man code team. 

As an early access supporter, you even have the first expansion for free, and the second expansion was free for everyone! 

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cian

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review! As a small indie developer all feedback is very important to us and we are glad to hear that you found the game fun.

We are currently in Early Access and still developing the game, so some of the points you raised will be addressed before full release.
- We are aware of issues with villagers getting stuck at granaries which is someting we are looking to improve and prevent in a future update.
- Housing is also a work in progress and will be greatly improved as we develop the game.
- More resources and production chains are being worked on through development and will be added in future updates.

Do not play this game, I tried coming back, but with 2+ hours of googling, asking veterans, using
search sites, I did not find a combat zone I could play like I wanted.
I also got a bounty for ""trespassing"" that I could never have avoided.

Games like this must be warned against and should not be played. This is simply unacceptable on all fronts.


Update: January 15 2023:""

Do not play this game, or Elite Dangerous Odysey;

The game is very unbalanced, buggy, unpolished and often frustrating; you will end up doing a lot of logging in and out.
FPS might be called lack of FPS as the FPS with the same settings in space is drastically lower. The game should have seperate graphics settings for that, but it doesn't.

FPS is wildly more profitable than anything else.

Frameshift drive is super annoying when it comes to planetary landings, sometimes you have to try 4 times and it randomly while re-attempting seems to go into the wrong 'mode' causing an instant exit and you having to wait for a cooldown, that can be avoided by logging in and out.

Doing trade with the fleet carrier is the single most profitable thing you can do and virtually zero risk.
The same is true for the FPS combat in combat zones. You can easily earn millions without any investment in the latter, if you simply focus on making kills of the enemies with the plasma-based sniper rifle. Finding grade 2 or 3 shotguns, snipers or plasma pistols and/or suits you can up your game and go through the enemy more quickly, sometimes racking up to 12 million in a single round of the capture-the-flag game where instead of defending and taking over points, all you need to do is hunt the enemy.

The only things I find fun in the game are unbalanced, and the things that are 'balanced' and 'risk' analyzed and such.. are so relatively underpowered, underwhelming and frustrating in their design that they do not hold my interest at all.














Edit: January 10, 2023.

After 7 years, I can still firmly thumb down this game. There are 3 major frustrations that I ran into virtually immediately when playing, together they have very strongly frustrated me for well over an hour:

- Frameshift and supercruise are bound to the same key, but if you want to leave a planet after setting a course , then you must first rebind them if you are trying to fly to a destination that happens to be on the other side of the planet and in a different system. You must rebind keys to do out-of-system cargo missions.
- Picking up cargo missions DOES NOT PICK UP CARGO anymore (you must manually use the ""cargo depot"". It took me 20 minutes of Googling and some obscure youtube tutorial that didn't even play properly to find out where to do this. Worse; this was totally inobvious to me and becuase of my scepticism I even checked whether the cargo was on board. It was not. I almost flew 123 lightyears with 8 system hops with a ship to deliver 'unique' biowaste (that can be picked up anywhere and costs nothing) to then deliver it far off for 300K credits. (which doesnt evne make sense)
3. When landing on planetary cities, the hangars are VERY difficult to find if you expect them to not be ON TOP but on the sides of the city. I flew around the entire city to find my dock, then after 6 minutes finally located it ON TOP of the city, and then landed in apparently a 180° incorrect direction to land, which makes no sense. It is completely inverted from other locations and you will always end up approaching from the center.

None of these points make any sense to me whatsoever. Who designed this?  Also I think the flying of the ships sucks, I prefer the realism  and flight controls of KSP, Space Engingers.. .hell, even Empyrion: Galactic Survival to the ones in this game.

Overall it's a boring flight simulator for me that feels desolate, even when you can get off your ship and 'interact' in the station. It's hollow and feels artificial. Just like No Man's Sky, I don't feel fully in control of my ship even when I literally am. Worse, the way you have to land in some places forces you to fully experience all of the inconveniences of the 'unique' downsides of how a ship is flown in this game.

I'm sorry for being so scathing, but a game that's managed to frustrate me for an hour straight after coming back to it after 7 years... and in new ways... No. Just No. I will not recommend this game and strongly recommend anyone stay away from it, unless they are willing to spend 1+ hour googling obscure and stupid issues with the most essential and simplistic aspects of this game. Hell, even the flight controls often sometimes take several minutes to Google, and worse, you're put on tight deadlines that if violated will result in your ship being blown up.

Realism is not to be found in this game, joy might be, but frustration is guaranteed. Guaranteed.

Previous/original review from october 2015 is below: 

I was determined on also buying a joystick for this game, but I will not, I do not see myself playing this game much, if at all in the future. 

My final verdict (I am currently removing local files): Boring and extremely frustrating. Many things are completely counter-intuitive: buy things legal in one place, sell in another where its illegal? Loss instead of profit??... Buy stuff that is 'exported' to a place... nowhere they will actually allow you to sell it, if it happens to be illegal there, and there is no big dock.
Bounty on you? No way to remove it.. oh wait; but it disappears, but if it is 'scanned' it sticks around 7 days and you cannot claim your own bounties.. Oh, and when you die, your 'bounty vouchers' disappear. This game is riddled with things that make no sense at all, and thus cause frustration when you run into them. I am deeply, deeply disappointed, and also very frustrated that I can't play the game I THOUGHT this was. 

I am a total sci-fi geek, I love space sims to bit, I loved Vega Strike to bits, I played KSP for over a 1000 hours.


The tutorial is completely worthless; after completing it  all you can do is manage to leave dock and travel to other planets and dogfight; but you're still left COMPLETELY uneducated on so, so many important things and without this knowledge, the game is ultimately extremely frustrating. But it is addictive, if you can put yourself past that.

However, my conclusion is that, finally mastering navigation without overshooting, stealthy smugling and exploring, there's nothing left to do, since everything is just repetition.

Sadly; the best way to turn a profit is to continually quit to main menu and switch between solo and open play, to stock up on smuggling operations to the very same destination to your cargo's capacity. (I can stack over 500.000 credits on one trip with my Cobra.) 

Ultimately it is all just flying between targets... slowly, without much interesting things to see, or do, unless you like doing this and getting the satisfaction of earning credits, in which case I highly recommend Adventure Capitalist.

P.S: In this game you have all of the disadvantages of a Single Player game and Multiplayer game combined, but none of the benefits.",1439056587,1697995348,False,14,0,0.4868267476558685,0,True,False,False,False,,,,359320

""What are you talking about? There aren't any players online!""

No, there aren't many players.  That's right.  But you know what there *are* many of?  BOTS!  Bots for days!  Glorious, glorious bots!  If you're a super competitive player, maybe that's not good enough for you.  But if you just want the shiny graphics and pew-pews, the bots will provide those things just as well as human players would.  Really need human players that much?  Get the four-pack and rope your friends into it.  Hell, you don't even need to do that.  Play with your family or roommates on LAN - only the host actually needs the full version.

Seriously though, the lack of active players is the *only* flaw I can see in this game.  If you're like me and don't mind fighting bots, rest assured that this game's bot battles are just as good as the multiplayer battles.  Same exact content, just better latency.

Also props to the devs for staying active on the forum and not being discouraged by people saying the game's dead.

I think this could be because you might be playing with the ""Programmer Captain"". We have different ""captains"" you can choose from, and all have different pros/cons. The programmer captain is for people who love to automate stuff with sensor and logic parts. You get unlimited parts and tries, but you can't directly control your drone :)

All other captains allow you to directly control your drone :)

I'm terribly sorry to tell you, however at the moment we are having issues with Mac builds and are hunting for solutions constantly. Seems to be a conflict with unity.
 
There are a couple of things that some of the Mac users have reported success with, please try them and let me know.
 
1. Force Quit Steam, launch Steam, attempt to launch the game.
2. Head to Steam Settings(Preferences) and check for Steam Client Update
3. Head to Steam Settings(Preferences) Click on Downloads and then click on the Clear Download Cache button.
 
Restart, launch the sim and test.
 
Another thing for you to test.
 
Please launch Steam. and click on the DRL Sim in your Steam Library.
Then click on the Settings cog wheel on the right side of the screen. Choose Manage and then Browse Local Files.
Please delete the two things you see there. should 4.1.3860.rls.osx.version and the other should be DRL Simulator.
Once deleted, head back to Steam, Click on the DRL Sim in your Steam library, click on the same settings cog wheel, and then Manage, this time click Uninstall.Once uninstalled, restart, head back to Steam, download the Sim, and let us know your results.

EA review:
I know this is EA, but i had high hopes you guys address the following issues reported earlier:
- poor looking starfield! yes, this is important part of a space game
- unconsistent UI designed to slow down your work
- horrible font choice. in addition the font size changes for each UI element. confusing to look at!
- radial menu still hides the action screen! seriously... is it that hard to use alpha?

Various performance issues in general when flying by huge objects. I mean why? How come in X:Rebirth those station complexes do not lag my gameplay?

I know my review sounds negative. Well, you need feedback to make your game better!

I'll go over the noted issues from your review if you don't mind.
- by starfield I believe you're referring to the skyboxes? I'm honestly not sure what more we can do other than upping the skybox textures to double resolution, but that will severely impact the required graphics RAM
- UI will receive further changes before the game is done
- is the problem with the font its size or the font in general?
- radial menu background and game pause are both things we said we'd take care of as an option for player to choose whether or not to use and we will. we simply had more pressing matters
- performance issues - we've done a first part of the optimization in this latest update by compressing all the models (this should have made loading times shorter). another step that will be done is compressing scripts which will reduce the ""stutter"" when something is going on (usually objects spawning). And finally, general optimization to increase performance. This last step can only come later, once everything or almost everything is finalized. Only then can we run detailed performance tests to see where the problems occur the most.

Thanks for the review once again. We do like and need the feedback :).",419480

I preordered the day I became aware of it's existence. I probably sank hundreds of hours into DK 1 and 2 in my adolescence and every couple of years I play through them even with the terrible emulation of Dosbox. So when I fired up WFTO and saw that it had the best of everything I remembered from both DK's I was ecstatic, the voice of the mentor was back, and it seemed to have the same sardonic humor I could barely contain myself. 

Then I started playing.

The game itself has the same dynamics of the originals. Carve out some rooms, beat some minions, watch the enemies impale themselves upon your floor spikes. But as you keep playing you realize this is just a shadow of what made the original DK great. There is little to discover (no special rooms to summon elite minions, no fun combinations of defenses, no fun things to do with posession) and you can win nearly every level of the campaign by building 5 or 6 beast pits and dropping a flag on the enemy core. In fact, through have the campaign that is exactly what you HAVE to do since defenses are practically worthless. I only found them useful in 1 campaign level. Usually the enemies will rush you so quickly you have no time to build defenses or train your minions and if you can withstand their attack you can immediately counter to win. 

If you do try and build up and turtle the campaign will just punish you with infinite waves of enemies that rush right passed all your minions to start banging on your core or with the flawless AI micromanagement. Where is the valiant freeing of prisoners? Looting the vaults? Why aren't rooms wrecked up and torched so they need to be fixed?

I kept playing despite the campaign really not being my style. I prefer to spend some time crafting a world then crushing my foes but, hey, it's nice to be pushed outside your comfort area now and again. As you keep playing the rough edges of the game will begin to grate through your resilience causing frustration and agony. The UI is sluggish and the buttons small. I have tried to click the little cancel attack flag circle and burrowed through the wall of my base too many times. Paging through the laggy menus to lighting bolt a worker who is stuttering around my base as the AI simultaneously blasts 6 of my workers while dropping 30 minions onto the square they just took in my base is psychological torture.  Or sometimes the game lags so bad you just drop a flag where you need to be and go make lunch, coming back 30 minutes later to see you won while AFK (level 9). 

The final nail in the coffin causing me to uninstall my hopes and dreams of a DK successor are the bugs. Workers standing around doing nothing. Defense parts never being delivered. Walls never being repaired. Dropping an attack flag and watching my soldiers walk into a wall while my core gets demolished. Possession freezing my computer. The game is unplayable in Linux and poorly running in Windows. Probably the worst was when I beat the second to last mission (level 12) and the game just never ended. Apparently there is a bug where you can capture an enemy core without destroying it making it impossible to win. For the record this was patch 1.1.7 which was supposed to be playable. As of now I wish I could get a refund, my 13 hours back, and to wash off this disappointment.",1435083069,1435083402,False,97,7,0.728708267211914,3,True,False,False,False,,1530720868.0,"Hi Degovx,

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. Two of these are completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Sorry to hear that Detached makes you feel uncomfortable. We try to warn all the players (also in the game description here on Steam) that Detached is intense game and it's not suitable for everyone.

I would like to remind that we prepared few control schemes for each controller (Touch controllers, Gamepad, Keyboard). You can choose the best one, which can be more recognizable from FPS games or VR. Player can also enable steering assist or Eagle Eye View to limit field of view in the most nauseating moments (pitch, yaw, acceleration etc.)

I hope maybe you will give Detached another chance soon! 

All the best,

The game features 3 different stories so it is technically three games in one, except that it isn't really as all of them feel fairly the same. Each of the stories is set in a different timeline, the past (a fantasy world), the present and the future.

[h1]The Modern story[/h1]

To be fair I didn't play it a lot, just launched it for about half an hour just to see how it plays like and I must say it was boring. There was that one joke with the toilet where you take a dump and the game gives you a fake ""game over"".

[h1] The Future story[/h1]

I've launched it for a moment to see how it would play, kind of used it as the game's last chance, it failed. Stared it, the characters looked really good, then I got into the game itself, the world seemed really empty compared to the two other stories. Got into a random fight against 4 enemies right at the start of the game, and then they killed me.

[h1]The Fantasy world[/h1]

The only one that has actually shown me some promise and kept me in for longer than 15 minutes. In this timeline you follow a story of Princess Yuki which is just about to get married but then it gets interrupted and you as a player have to kill the four elemental slime kings and collect something from them, you know, Final Fantasy 1 style. I've had one problem with it though, it does introduce a lot of characters in such a short time which just doesn't let you as a player get to know a certain character from the start and then maybe switch to another character, but instead you get introduced to around 7 characters in the first 15 minutes of the game, so you have no idea on what each of the characters are all about.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

In general I don't think this game is worth the price which it is going by right now, around £15. It does have some nice points in it though, for example the freedom of choice between the top-down and a first person camera. I have no complaints about the top-down view, it's good and smooth. First person was a good idea, but sometimes when you try to move the camera around with your mouse, it might take you a while as it likes to get out of the game screen, otherwise it's a good idea to have, didn't feel too bad to use it but it could use some polishing.

There were also a couple visual bugs/gliches, for example in the 2D section of the Fantasy world my character's head got gliched in one of the wall tiles of the game. There was also no transitions between different dialogues, so for example you would see the characters talking, the background would be trees for example, then it would just instantly switch to a castle or something. At least there was a lot of effort put into the character art and a fairly good soundtrack, not the best but there was worse.

4/10 - wouldn't reccomend it as it is now, if the price goes down, sure, why not. If you do however feel like you would enjoy the game then by all means, check it out and see if you like it!

I see a lot of other reviews here talking about the ""amount of content"". I think those people are not understanding what kind of game this is. It's an ARCADE style shooter. The point is to replay it over and over to try to get a better score AND to have fun with it, doing trick shots and overall just enjoying the game mechanic for what it is.

Anyone here that said they ""beat"" the whole game in 12 minutes are idiots. No you didn't, you just played each level at each difficulty once and thought that's it. The first few times I played it was hard, I was throwing orbs and slowing to shoot, but it seemed like i was surfing the line between total chaos and being in control.

THAT'S WHEN IT CLICKED!! The key to this game is using the SLOW MO, use it A LOT!!! I can NOT stress how much more fun this game becomes when you start using the slow mo feature as much as you can. DID YOU KNOW that you can heal while in slow mo? It quickly becomes obvious that the trick to survival is milking that slow mo whenever you are starting to die. The fun for me also came in the realization that I DO have the time to plan each throw and aim with precision. To shoot each orb right in front of a robots face and watch that awesome rag doll take over. Once you get the hang of this game, it's easy to go in feeling like a badass! Neo style taking out robots one after another. Hitting that slow mo, then turning around just in time to see a robot flying through the air straight at me and shooting him in the head, decapitating him, right before he lands.... absolutely, BADASS!!!

Plus it's only $5 right now, I have eaten $5 of Taco Bell in about 10 minutes and never thought twice about it again. How are you people complaining about the worth of this game when it's only $5? I cant replay my taco bell....

TLDR: This game is meant to be replayed, its an ARCADE game. Not Skyrim. Give it some time to master the mechanics, there is a learning curve. And finally, use that SLOW MO!!! If you use it to its full potential, you can be like Neo in the Matrix.

I've noticed far more bugs in the first 3 stages than I have in the entirety of the first Freedom Planet, frequently clipping through terrain and objects, weird audio quality drops in VO, and on the very first boss somehow triggering a bug that made me invulnerable after I was supposed to die. Most of these can be fixed with a patch, though the cognitive overload of the pixel art may be difficult to patch. The thing that I think can't be patched though?

Cons: No (Extremely Low) replayability.
          Some minor bugs. (Not what most post. They aren't bugs but actually part of the game 
          design.)

Steam needs another kind of recommendation: Meh? Indifferent? Something.

This game is basically a puzzle. Figuring out how many of each kind of job you need, how to handle each enviroment (Planet Type), managing both resource and job priorities *** IS THE GAME ***. (And is pretty much all there it to the game.)

If you read all the spoilers/cheats, there is nothing in the game for you as it has very low replayability. What you are competing against is your ability to manage the above mentioned variables. So your job is to manage and build a base while hitting all the milestones until it finally gets to 300 population.

It is a realitively easy game, the challenge is once again; figuring out the balances of the variables. If you are intelligent and problem solve well, you will likely be bored, or perhaps think like me that it is exactly what you paid for.

That said. A lot of people are reporting things as bugs that actually are not bugs. i.e. If you run low on power, and your then airlocks will not operate. And all the evil that befalls after that is NOT A BUG: It is the game. You messed up. Fixing the issue, (...or actually avoiding it in the first place...) before your base dies is part of playing the game.

Being unable to properly manage types of personnel, job priorities, repairs, security, power, O2, etc... IS NOT A BUG. ***** That is you losing the game. *****

Almost EVERYTHING that goes wrong in the game is UNFORGIVING. And mismanaging priorities is why you are out of <Insert Whatever Here>. (That isn't a complaint about the game. It was in fact one of the few things that made the game good.)

I value replayability very highly in a builder game. There is no replayability here. There are no competing bases, resources are unlimited (...and only run low if you aren't prioritizing correctly). So after playing through once, all you have left is a different map, and RND events from traders/aggressors.

At the end of the day you aren't going to be sad you bought it. But you are going to be sad that it seemed to have a ton of ""What if..."" and potential that just isn't there because of no replayability or competition.",1503767028,1503775436,False,48,0,0.6892339587211608,5,True,False,False,False,,1505596013.0,"Hi there,

Thank you for your feedback, we always read users reviews and take them in account to improve our game.

Although you can build most small structures at the beginning, the metagame changes quite a lot later on: you will have to optimize your base for a larger amount of colonists, build bigger domes, deal with intruders and tend to radio transmissions among other things.

Also once you master the first planet you can try out the more advanced ones, as they have different starting condtions, weather patterns, disasters and higher difficulty over all, especially the Storm one.

Additionally we've also recently added the new Challenges, which are tests that let you approach the game in a different way.

Overall the game is designed for about 20-30 hours of gameplay, which taking in account it's $20 price tag should hopefully be reasonable value for money.

Regards.
Martiño.",403190

Thank you for your feedback.

If you look for a more linear experience may i suggest to try the prologue first, before starting a new game in Die Young?
You can simply right click on game name on steam library and hit 'Play Prologue'.

Die Young: Prologue is a story with a different protagonist ( Nehir ) that happens approximately 24 hours before the beginning of Die Young.
It is shorter than Die Young and is a complete ( not early access ) game on its own with a beginning and an end. It is more linear experience ( both for the level design and for the story ) and, other than telling you infos about the background of the island, it acts also like a sort of 'mini tutorial' to familiarize with Die Young mechanics.

Die Young, instead, is intended more like an experience with a certain degree of freedom on what to explore, where to go and which quests to make and in which order.

I've played a lot of this game. Not as much as others have, granted. But I have 650 hours at the time of this review. There's a lot to say, but I'll keep it somewhat short and sweet. This game is complex, it's a simulation and not so much a game. That being said, the new odyssey update that came out in April is absolutely broken and has been for a long time and will be for a long time.

Basically, this game is no man's sky on release, right now. AI is broken as ♥♥♥♥, planets are all bland as hell. And the ones that wouldn't be bland, you can't land on any way. There's a lot to explore and do, but it all feels hollow and repetitive.

It could go two ways. The route no man's sky went, fix everything and constantly add insane free updates to say sorry to the community. No man's sky was the biggest redemption story in gaming. To this day, they still frequently add amazing content updates. Or it could go the route that many other games went, most notably anthem. Amazing promises made and not fulfilled, bland and boring game play and grinds for bland items and upgrades.

If elite dangerous goes the route of anthem, I'll be extremely sad. This game has so much promise and if it goes the route of no man's sky, could be the biggest redemption in gaming history. It has so much to offer and so much potential, but they need to listen to the community more. Stop giving us what you think we want. Give us what we are asking for.

That being said, the game has enough in it to keep you busy for hundreds of hours for sure. It's pretty good, if you can get past the bugs and never ending grind. But has the potential to be so, so much better. 8/10",1536090935,1632342721,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,,,359320

What if the activities are repetitive and since I don't have any friends to play the game with (don't judge), exploring gets boring as well?"" Well, after buying the game and started playing, once in a long time, I was actually captivated for a good amount of time! Car control feels good, the sounds are really good, and the graphics look fine too despite some of the texture quality being kinda off (understandable since the world is pretty huge and all). The game's collision physics is pretty ridiculous. The activities in this game do have some kind of variety. Some of them are really fun I keep replaying them now and then. If you want to earn money and get new cars, you just have to do those activities and since some of them are pretty fun to replay, you keep getting cash as you complete them. When you level up, you also get a good amount of money. It's not anything like pay to win. I haven't experienced much PvP gameplay though.

The game's world is really awesome and feels great to explore in your favorite car! From the streets of Manhattan to the Grand Canyon highway, the landscapes are really nice. And if you like to use photomode in games (like me), this game will give you great opportunity to take some really good shots. Trust me, you will start spending more time on the photomode once you start using it. Same scene from different angles, at different time of day and different weather, you can't have enough of the photomode. Access to land, air and water vehicles makes exploring even better!

The Crew 2 has a good variety of vehicles- from Lamborghini Aventador to the legendary Pontiac Firebird (KITT), from street racing to offroad rally, Harley Davidson to Suzuki - the diversity is huge! I have to mention the visual customizing. People can actually create their own livery and upload it for other players. Trust me, these liveries know no bound. Expect to see ""P*rnhub"" and Fake Taxi liveries. Police liveries are pretty common. There's a lot more and of course, you can always create your very own livery.

The Crew 2 is diverse, fun and beautiful. The whole United States is your playground. It has enough to captivate you for hundreds of hours. Just don't expect hardcore racing. Have fun!",1590607749,1619023276,True,0,1,0.0,0,False,False,False,False,,,,646910

If you generally liked the game, but gave it a ""Thumbs Down"" review because of its playerbase, please allow a quick word from the devs behind TOXIKK:

A) You're reviewing the game, not its playerbase. Note that Steam automatically reduces the visibility of games with many ""Thumbs Down"" reviews (assuming these games are less worth playing) which results in less people finding (aka playing) TOXIKK.

B) Arena FPS is a niche genre and you'll not find the figures of mainstream shooters in TOXIKK. More info about server activity and the game's playerbase can be found at: https://steamdb.info/app/324810/graphs/

C) During main hours, you should easily find multiple active matches. However, if you want to play during less populatd hours and don't find enough matching challenges, you may want to visit the community's live chat hangout on our Discord server at http://chat.toxikk.com

D) Last but not least, TOXIKK features an extensive single-player/bot mode that allows you to either play missions (contracts) or freely configurable matches in the full version of the game. In the free version, empty slots on the online servers are filled with bots.


So, you can always play a few matches with the full and the free edition of TOXIKK, when you have that Arena FPS itching.


Thanks and have a great day,

Hi there,

Thank you for your feedback.

We've added many features to the game since this review was written, like the new Storm Planet, new structures, techs and a lot more.

Maybe you would consider getting the latest version and playing the game again.

Long story short: devs are incompetent and painfully amateur.

I had high hopes for this game, played it a lot, bought copies for friends, posted in the forums, the whole nine yards.

But patch after patch was ridiculous, drastic, buggy, game changing updates from the devs along with constant item wipes. They have no concept of game design and no idea what they want. They are also vindictive and immature when they delete negative forum threads and insult their user base.

This game should STILL be early access, 2 years after release. Crying shame that it's considered ""finished"". Oh well, I guess I expected too much. At least I know to avoid these devs and Panic Art Studios.

EDIT: Haha the developer response, I just can't stop laughing. Hero Siege still needs to be early access, just look at the patch notes to see what I mean. Seriously take a read, or check the forums, the perpetual churn is STILL happening.
A ""final product on Steam"" doesn't drastically change core mechanics and systems 2 years after release (just figure out mana, attack speed, item progression, HUD style, levelling, and waves, etc. already). Also excellent strategy to blame the community, I'm happy to see you guys are still unprofessional, immature, and rude.
Nice try Panic Art Studios, but your game is still junk and this review is still 100% accurate.

EDIT: 2017 update, 3 years since release, they are removing the core wave system and adding quests to their game. Seems like a drastic change for a ""mature"" and ""finished"" product that's ""totally out of early access"". What a joke.

EDIT: 2019 update, well I forgot 2018 because this game is terrible, but hey look they're rewriting it from the ground up! Because why not when the finished product is basically early access anyway?! https://steamcommunity.com/games/269210/announcements/detail/1720837069012973330

EDIT: 2020 update, in case you missed it the CEO of this terrible company is really racist and xenophobic, search ""Hero Siege racist"" or (if the link is still up) look at https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/f7vli0/ceo_of_panic_art_studios_posted_this_on_twitter/

EDIT: 2023 update, oh hey there's an entirely new ""2.0"" release for this endlessly tweaked and poked game. I have never seen devs flounder and rewrite their game so consistently for so long: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/269210/view/3711586011325739655

My previous complaints were that the way the inventory system works can potentially leave you in a spot that makes it impossible to progress.  In short, whenever you use an item in your inventory that item is gone forever, even if you exit the game and reload.  As it turns out, there is a way to acquire more healing potions and other items necessary to progress, though the way you do so, while allows you to avoid getting stuck forever, brings with it a whole host of lesser problems.  Basically, there's a ""Quest Mode"" in the main menu, which you can hop on over to at any time and fight a series of enemies which allows you to grind for XP and healing items.  The obvious problem with this is that it basically forces the player to exit the main game and grind the items necessary to continue.  And while I have nothing against grind, so long as it's optional and the player is allowed to do it at their own volition, it is never a good idea to force the player into doing it.  Because while there are people out there who find the exercise fun (I being among them) there's a whole host of others who will find it very tedious and very tiring very fast.  To a lesser annoyance, this mechanic also forces you to exit the main game mode and play what basically amounts to a side activity before you can continue, which breaks the flow of the game somewhat.  The annoyance is lessened in this instance since the loading screen are few and brief, and you'll be back in the main meat of the game relatively quick, but it's still there, and I still can't help but feel this whole problem could be avoided simply by allowing items to respawn after you die in combat, or reload your game.

Now this has been a lot of negativity so far, but I put it up front because these were serious problems which prevented me from enjoying the game as fully as I'd like to, and the last thing I want to do is give the impression that this game is not worth your time, because it absolutely is.

The combat mechanics are very well executed, similar to other turn-based games such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Stick of Truth.  And like all good turn based RPG's you'll start off being able to get through by bashing your way through brute force, but sooner or later you will have to adopt a strategy to go along with muscle, and you'll need to think through each of your actions in order to succeed.  It starts off simple enough but quickly becomes more complex and difficult as more characters are introduced and new combat mechanics are thrown in.  Turn based strategy nerds will find themselves right at home here, and there's also a nice learning curb for newcomers as well.

What sets this game apart from its contemporaries, however, is the unique art style and overall aesthetic of game and story.  It literally feels like you're playing a comic book, which may sound like a concept which has been done before, but not like this.  Infamous was done in a comic book style, but it didn't feel like you were playing a comic book.  TellTale games are done in comic book styles, but they don't feel like you're playing a comic book.  This, from beginning to end, feels like you're literally playing a comic book.  From the cartoony art style of the characters to the how the whole story is told using speech bubbles and pop-up text, to how every cutscene and even gameplay sections are transitioned using comic book panels, every detail has been fine tuned to give off this vibe colorful comic book goodness.  The developer really should be applauded for how much thought went into every detail to make the game feel this way.

Story wise, Light Apprentice is your basic fantasy affair, though with some slight alterations to make things a little more interesting.  You play as Nate, a boy who's been trapped in time for a few hundred years, and is suddenly awakened in order to save the world with his mystical power granted to him by the earth.  Yes, I'd be lying if I said I didn't see the avatar similarities as well.  But where avatar was sort of Disneyfied in its storytelling Light Apprentice is a little darker, allowing you to choose whether to kill or spare your opponents and even decide on some other moral choices throughout the plot.  These moral choices spice up the story, though they're not really as complex as we've seen in other games like The Walking Dead, nor are they played around with like they were in Undertale.  It's a good addition to the game, but not as well implemented as it could be.

Overall, I would absolutely recommend this game, especially if you're one for a good story and unique style this is a definite buy for you, and I look forward to what the developer has in store for this game as well as their future endeavors.",1489891612,1489990094,True,11,0,0.6085237264633178,4,True,False,True,False,,1489921763.0,"Hi!

I first started out with the Demo  and the  pirated verstion that they them self  released. Once  when I played it I  just knew I had to play it. The game is good but hard. The only issue is with how they deal with steam workshop.  This game NEEDS mods because while it is fun it gets done after you 6th time you played it. 

The game  is fun, but  ir really needs mods. Most of the mods are based on one  mode  UltraLib. This mod no  longer works. In order to get a  working version you have to go to  a  modified version and compile  it  from scource. 85% of all mods use THIS ONE package and now none of them work. As mentioned  they own the source code so there is no  excuse. The devs claim they  have a good mod API, and sure it might be from the  dev's side. The end user finds it annoying and  a pest.  You only have one menu to enable or disable mods.  This  has no effect on your following status on there steam workshop page. This  means the  game has no way to stop you from downloading broen mods. This means you  need to  have both the steam workshop and game open at the same time. Finding mods that  are broke is now harder  thanks to steam workshop's new css layout. They should at l east have a button for  ultralib so you can filtuer them out.

Then you have the  broken warning messages.  When ever some thing goes wrong you get  a warning message. When you have a bunch of mods this measn a bunch of messages that  do not go away until you click them. It has been YEARS and  we still can not  turn them off.  If a mod breaks some thing I should know what one it is in the  message.  This game is old so if the api was so  good as the dev claimed why did it not have it 2 years ago when they broke the steam workshiop.  Kind of funny t hat the pirated  copys still work a s they do not  updated when the legitmant copys break on start because steam workshiop  turns on all mods at once.  The fact  that the devs have never thought about any of  these features shows they do not use this feature. 

oh and then there is whole ""hate speach"" thing. I  know this  is  because Valve sold out to chinese investor.

I'm glad that in general it seems you've enjoyed the game with the exception of the timed achievements for the campaign levels. Thought I'd drop by and offer our current perspective on them.

By design these achievements are intended to be particularly tough, because earning all the achievements grants a unique reward in the form of a special worker skin we want to make sure that worker skin remains desirable and prestigious. In that way we want the time runs to be a real achievement.

Oftentimes if you're struggling with the achievements you can ask help from the community and they can usually provide some insight in the best way to approach a level.

As far as we are aware all these achievements are within the intended brackets of difficulty with extremely well practiced and experience players being able to beat the level with multiple minutes to spare, you'll find many guides online though some may be out of date with re-balancing (to which we've loosened some of the time restrictions as necessary).

With all that said we have another big balance pass on the way in the coming months during which we'll also have to consider the impact it has on the timers. I'll be passing your feedback along when we discuss them and we'll consider whether we want to loosen the difficulty as a whole.

Hope that helps provide some insight.

Cheers,

Lee",230190

My issue with SE right now isn't paid DLC, it isn't the price. It's the principle of the matter. 6 weeks after the game came out of early access for a full/gold release the first update they do is paid DLC. Steam doesn't allow me to set a ""I enjoy this game, but I don't agree with what the Devs are doing"" That's what this review is about, I don't agree with the direction they are going. It's not that I can't recommend the game, it's that I can't recommend what the Devs are doing. This review is a statement. This is my opinion of the game in it's current state. There is far too much potential that is being wasted and that worries me. 

I have been playing Space Engineers for almost most of it's development time. I have over 1700, and at least that much in modeling and modding for this game. Things have been going down hill for some time now. This recent update (the first after the official release and coming out of Early Access) added Paid DLC to the game. These blocks are ""decorative"" blocks, as keen calls them, that look similar to mods on the workshop already. They also have functions to them, such as a cockpit (which has a good amount more health than the other cockpits in game) a holo table that projects a small projection of a Blueprint, and a locker that stores your equipment. These are more than decorative blocks, these are functional blocks. I find it sad and scummy that Keen finally added blocks to the game that users have been asking for for years not even 6 weeks after ""release"" and expect money for them. They claim it's for future support and development, but why now after 6+ years of development do they suddenly need to offer paid DLC? I think about the potential this game has, and how it's going to waste trying to turn it into a AAA game with loot boxes and paid DLC. In a game about building blocks and creativity, locking blocks behind a paywall makes no sense for the consumer. Also it wasn't about the price ever but I love how I'm being attacked for my opinion.",1554993965,1555340323,False,269,15,0.6594330668449401,53,True,False,False,False,,1555622882.0,"Hi Spacebar,

It’s the kind that stays with you long after you have finished playing it.

Primordia is a game with outstanding writing, stunning artwork, soulful music and simple, but charming animations, all of which come together to create a truly captivating and memorable world.

The puzzles are fun and personally I had a blast exploring the world and hearing what the characters have to say in order to solve them, Memento’s being my favorite. Some might seem difficult, but the solution tends to be pretty simple. I haven’t played a point and click game in ages and it took me a bit to re-familiarize myself with the mechanics, so if you’re finding yourself struggling, that’s probably why!

The amount of voice lines written and recorded for the game is incredible, from simply inspecting things and interacting with them to idle banter and using items on something that you wouldn’t even expect to have a custom line. If you think you’ve heard most of what the characters have to say, chances are you haven’t!

Friendly banter between the characters gives me life. The fact that Horatio and Crispin care so deeply and genuinely for each other not despite their differences, but rather thanks to them, is really heartwarming. I am absolutely in love with these guys.

I’ve had only two problems with the game, first being misleading wording on the second question of a certain logic-related puzzle, which damaged my perfectionist I-solved-every-puzzle-myself pride a bit, but it’s nothing I can’t live down, especially considering this seems to have been discussed with and heard by the developers dozens of times by now. The other one is, in my understanding, an engine-specific bug, which causes music playing in the background to move to the audio setting, essentially causing two tracks to play at the same time. It affects your entire save and it cost me my second playthrough and quite some footage I'd been gathering due to me not realizing it was happening on time. (Moral of the story? Keep more save files!)

I’m not a particularly eloquent person in either of two languages I speak, but hey. This game pushed me to actually try and put my thoughts and emotions into words for a review for the very first time, so that has to mean something. I have been thinking about this game for the past few days and probably will continue doing so for years to come. Horatio and his friends have etched themselves deep into my soul, right next to stories I hold very near and dear. Did my personal history amplify that resonance? Probably. But that’s what stories do, don’t they? Among other things, they show you that you are not alone in whatever you’re going through.

Very grateful for being able to experience such a gem, even if I am a decade late. Thank you for creating and sharing it and good luck with your future projects, WWS.

TL;DR
Ups: Good Concept. Good mechanics. Can be really fun to create your own drone. PvP with automated drone.
Downs: Not as fun as when it was in beta, Upgrade and progress can be halted by procedural generation.
6/10
=============================
NOTE THAT THERE IS SPOILERS:

The game was fun in beta (befoer the eraly access on Steam), getting random weapons and upgrades as rewards for progression. Just focus on making weird and wonderful drones that fits your imgination.

Now? Nah. Upgrades? You need to spent time digging. Special guns? Nope, just a skill tree now. Progress? Nope, all the remining missions are the ones you dont like ... Fun? Well ...

Excluding the PvP drones, which are still really fun.

Most of the other missions are basically the same thing. The snake eggs are annoying, because they can be quite hard to find in a large planet. So everything else seems .. the same. There is the barrel mission, but there is special place in hell for it later.

Amongst the other missions, (which ae mostly the same thing anyways) there is only one that i hate fromthe bottom of my soul. Perhaps it is because i dont find it interesting, or maybe it really is a stupid mission. I would like the devs to take a serious note.

The barrels, oh god the barrels. To put this simply, you are asked to design a drone with a magnet, in order to pick up 5 barrels to clean up a planet. What they dont tell you is that every barrel is guarded by ITS VERY OWN PERSONAL tower that outputs a large amount of damage, and explodes when you shoot it down. (Who guards interplanetary bio trashwith high tech towers?) These towers are generally placed practically next to the barrels, so have fun picking the barrel up and carrying it back to your mothership ^^. Oh, did i mention that the barrels are destructable? and they explode? and sometimes they explode for no reason? And that while 5 barrels may not seem like a lot, most of the time they only give you around 7 per mission? And that there may or may not be other enemy which may or may not explode which will blow up the barrels if they hit it a couple of time? So its just reset after reset, and hope that the barrels' gurdian angel dont shoot the barrel to ruin your mission every reset.

This will be bearable if you effort is rewarded, but guess what? the only reason you do them is to progress to later stages (like every other stage). You get nothing from doing them. NOTHING, not even resources. Thanks to procedural generation, sometimes, you may be as unlucky as I am. Where all your missions are done except for the barrel missions (I have like 5 of them ...) and every barrel, in each stage, is nearly impossible to pick up. I can kill the enemies and scout out where the barrels are. However, if i do that, the towers will explode with the barrels (because they are touching, not just close to each other, touching), and the mission is a fail. 

Your may think that i am stuck .. but no. I am already on my second run of this game, and the same problem occurs. Its not that it is impossible. No, it is simple not fun after a while (after you created a robot that can finish each type of mission with no problems, and when you try to make something else work it fails miserably) And trying on the literally same mission on different planets just adds to that misery.

Since this is still in early access, I wont grill the game itself, I likse the game, a lot in fact. 
But some of these things, like a single pixel of terrain that cant be removed by a LASER scan. Can completely stop your ship and force a reset. i dont even want to mention the number of times i had to reset because the bloody tower shoots the barrels that are your mission criteria. 

Maybe when the game is officially out, i will review it again. But right now, the game is only about a 6/10 in my book, better than most, but still needs a lot of work.",1538780078,1538780078,False,15,1,0.6781994700431823,0,True,False,True,False,,1587656605.0,"Hi FuyuMoro

Serious note taken!

Thanks for the detailed feedback, we really appreciate it :)

Edit: We reworked the barrel mission and added two more mission types so that you won't encounter it so often.

We also indeed need to find a solution for those tiny parts that can block the way.
If you'd like to discuss different kinds of unlocking and progression with us, please come join the forums! https://strayfawnstudio.com/community/index.php?/forum/4-nimbatus-the-space-drone-constructor/

Edit (April 2020): Nimbatus is now finished and will leave Early Access in 3 weeks.
Many things new features and lots of content has been added and many things have been reworked and improved. It would be great if you could take another look at the game and let us know what you think!

A decent romp for genre lovers that is riddled with too many bugs and crashes to be worth it. 

I enjoyed this game. I really like their choice of setting, I think they chose their mechanics well in how they mesh together. 

It's a solid game. But it gets repetitive. Enemy variety is a big problem, for one thing. They introduce more enemy types as you go on, and there's actually a decent few, but you interact with most of them in exactly the same ways. Because of this it doesn't feel like there's very much variety. While there are a good number of characters, a lot of them play similarly and they all lack variety when it comes to in-battle choices. It doesn't feel like it brings much new to the tactics genre besides, everything it wants to do FTL and X-Com have already done better. 

The only thing it really adds to the table is a blessing and a curse: it's low stress. It's not deep. It can be boring. But in that, it can also be quietly satisfying if you're just a fan of the genre. Personally, because of that I enjoy the game. 

But why am i thumbs downing? Crashes and bugs aplenty my friend. They've recently updated the game and now when I start my old adventure the game just crashes. At least I got to the battle first, last time! And this isn't the first time I've been locked out of an adventure because of constant crashing. As far as I'm concerned, releasing a game that doesn't work is fraud. It's inexcusable this is allowed to be a norm. Fix your game, then release it. Not the other way around.
 
I'd urge you to avoid this game on principle. But honestly, you're not missing all that much. 
This game is recommended only to die-hard tactics genre fans who need a fix.",1557111168,1557180912,False,12,0,0.6387204527854919,0,True,False,False,False,,1557335637.0,"Hi there,

Thanks for your feedback - it's noted. We're actively working on addressing some of the issues you've brought up.

I wanted to specifically address the crash you're experiencing as I think this is something we can fix for you. In general we do extensive testing on everything, but sometimes we miss things and that sucks. I can totally understand your frustration and as a developer there's nothing more frustrating than realizing we missed something. However, we are totally committed to fixing these issues.

Unless I'm mistaken I think the problem you're experiencing has already been fixed in the latest patch. When we released 1.0.9 there was indeed an issue that caused a crash for some people when finishing a combat. We fixed that issue quickly in the first 24 hours after the update. If the game still crashes for you on the latest build, I'd love to take a look at your save and see what causes the issue. If that's the case, could you send us an email at hello@robotality.com?

Thanks again!

9/10 and well worth the asking price.
Neon XSZ was in EA for quite a time but it turned out to be mind blowing when it came to the final build.  Paul updates his games on a very regular basis.  Very true of Neon XSZ and also of Space Bob vs. The Replicons.
Space Bob vs. The Replicons has a sound footing and it has only just been released.

I've played AE since the very early days of AQ and DF, i was invited to the alpha, and as you can see by my play time, i have.... Far too many hours in this game, but.. That being said? Was it worth it? And im sorry to say this, but no... In fact, in the last year, ive barely touched it, the updates have been ""okay"" - but there are major, major problems with this, that hasnt been adressed for many years

Pay to win, is an obvious thing to call this game, and it very much so it, its a very manipulative tactic used by this game, often - in fact, they spend more development time, creating new ""collections"" for you to buy, using their currency, than they do actually improving their systems, that should have changed since the beginning of this title! 

Its been years and the combat, is still, one of the dullest combat experiences of my life, when the akriloth (dragon boss fight) came it, and many other boss fights came in, THAT improved it a bit - however.. The combat of your character itself is just, mash 4 buttons and do the same skills OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER, you can alter -1- ability by grinding a lot and getting one of a handful of classes up, and then you get option to change that 1 skill, but that is the extent of what you can bring to the table, the only way for your character to feel -you- is by doing ""transmogs"", its incredibly unsatisfying and havent changed in years

The grind.. Oh the grind, the major reason why i stopped, EVERY few months, a new update would come out, and ""here we go again, lets kill 500 of the same 3 mobs, using the same dull combat system, over and over, to get ""that new random currency to buy those random transmogs and items which makes the previous progress nullified at least to some extent"" 

Dont get me wrong, i LOVE artix and the devs, they are amazingly good, kind, and wonderful people! And they DESERVE the success, more than ANY other devs, and i mean this thoroughly - nobody else has stuck as much with their games through their years... And i've played them since i was but a teen! So you have NO IDEA how much it pains me, to write -this- review, and not a glowing one filled with love, because thats what i thought, hoped, wished, that this game could become. 

But its sadly just become; A monotonous grind, hoping for whales & sales, with dull, unsatisfying repeatedly grindy systems, and the most boring combat, that i've seen.

And with how much i love AE... You can trust me when i say; i dont recommend it.. If you WANT nostalgia, and a chuckle? Go ahead, give it a spin, but PLEASE do not give in and support WHAT IT HAS BECOME...

And if AE sees this? Please... Change your ways? I love, respect you, i was one of your first, ive even supported you through 5-10 collections, dragon guardian, multiple other ways... And in other games, too.. I WANT to support you, but -THIS- is what you've done to someone that genuinely supported you all these years... PLEASE be the change, be the developers i know you -CAN- be... Thankyou for reading.",1644906451,1644906451,False,92,2,0.8481705784797668,7,False,False,True,False,,1644962188.0,"Hiya Frost. Artix here. I was deeply concerned and saddened to read your review. As a long time player with nearly 300 hours of play time, you have been with us from the start. I would like to make this better for you and any others who feel the same. What changes or features would to see? 

Over the past year we have added new features such as PvP and Captstones. I think it would be challenging to overhaul our combat system at this point, but we could add new classes and skills. 

I was confused by your pay to win comment. We do not have any pay to win content in the game. The game keeps its servers online by selling cosmetic items. Over the past year or so we also added free troves which players can build through quests. 

Please give us a chance to win you back. What specific things could we do to improve the game for you?

Battle on!

The only major improvements I could see being added to make it more playable are as follows:
I think the game needs is the ability to create more than one connection between buildings, water, and energy sources.   I can see where some more management of resources could be added, such as within a single building, setting the priorities on the various components.
Add a level of variety between the food varieties and general health.  ie, meat or veggies = food.  Instead, perhaps different types of food that are required, such as calorie heavy, citrus (can't let them get scurvy!), and such.
Adding non-synthetic meat sources would be a pretty cool addition.

 Illy is LONG term. It is the most complex RTS I have ever played. It also has the most freindly community of any other game I've played- idiots will be hammered very quickly, veteran players will happily send you resources if you ask (politely) in GC.

To start off here are a few things I ran into that I feel need work, sometimes when I attack with my short sword or mace the attack does not land where as the enemy keeps hitting me it's like Morrowind all over again. sometimes when the wizard skeleton hits me even with the mana shield active I fly back or up like 30ft I have also been hit so much to the point I clip through the map fall and die. The level up system seems to not work fully or unnecessary when I level up my weapons do the same amount of damage but the enemies do double even though they are my level and the last glitch is sometimes the enemies get stuck in a attack animation loop 

Now for things I feel you can add later on, 1) add a brightness bar or torch because the starting cell is super dark. 2) would be nice to have a map, 3) I would love to see armor, bows, and magic added later on, 4) maybe add some hands to the weapons so it does not look like I am a floating sword, and 5) if you can I would love to see you add more swords to the game or make the weapons level up with you.",1578116353,1578116671,True,2,0,0.521965503692627,1,True,False,False,False,,,,723070

There are definitely positives to the game notably the nutrition system works quite well and real life medical problems with the exception of exhaustion flow very well within the game. It is also quite funny to have to remove your pants so as to prevent your character simply squatting and taking a deuce directly in your underwear, a misstep requiring many a rare bars of soap to clean.",1708751707,1708751707,False,2,0,0.0,0,True,False,True,True,,1708936548.0,"Hi CopLegacy! We're sorry to see that the game left you disappointed in certain aspects. The exhaustion mechanic kicks in if you are bringing your character always to the brink of his/hers physical abilities, meaning that things such as prolonged sprinting sessions with weights on your back can bring your character down quickly. That is why sometimes it is a good idea to rest on chairs, beds, or simply lying on the ground so that your character doesn't get exhausted.

As for the reloading, you do not have to manually place a magazine into your weapon each time you want to reload. The only manual thing that you have to do is place bullets into the magazine. However, if you have a magazine in your inventory that has bullets in it, you can simply press 'R' to reload your weapon.

Also, we checked the situation with defecation and we have found that the character does not soil themselves if you pick the 'Poop' option through the Tab menu. You only do so if you do not manage to do that intentionally, which then results in your character relieving themselves with their clothes on.

I was a huge fan of Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2 and was so excited about this game, I was a backer for the game and have followed it for quite some time.

It isn't nice to play, I know it is meant to be evil but the problem is the units don't work well.  When fighting they bounce and float around, they all stack and pile on each other, deselecting things is sometimes quite hard (potions for example) and you can't cancel build orders for potions either.

The game feels like Dungeon Keeper in a lot of respects but not just in the good ways, it feels like a game from 10 years ago.  I was hoping for a new & improved game with lots of awesome extra little things, information and a game that really got you involved.  This game is not that, I wouldn't recommend spending the money on this semi finished fairly lame attempt at Dungeon Keeper 3 which ended up being Dungeon Keeper 1.5.  If you've played DK before skip this game as there is nothing that feels new or exciting and if you haven't then skip this game as it will feel outdated and buggy.",1455935686,1455935686,False,0,0,0.4761904776096343,1,False,False,False,False,,1456333820.0,"Hi Chaz,

I'm truly sorry to hear that you're dissapointed with the game, especially as you've been following the project for such a long time and are responsible for helping to make it a reality. Firstly I'd like to thank you for that support that helped to get this game off the ground.

I would like to say we're commiteted to continuing our support of the game with new features and improvements over the coming months. Perhaps you'll see some things make it in that will 

With regards to deselecting and cancelling potions, once you've got a potion in your hand you can either drop it into a cauldron in the world or onto the free cauldrons tab in the potion interface, this will drop it into a random cauldron if one is free. I do think these needs to be made clear to the player at some point and I'll see if there's anything we can do on that.

Cancelling potions I'm personally in agreement on. Originally it was possible to cancel a potion order by right-clicking the interface, however to make it consistent with the rest of the tabs we simply had it zoom to the in-progress potion (Which a slap will cancel) but after playing with it following your review I think it needs to be looked at again.

I'll have a chat with our designer about that.

Finally on combat, that's much more of a difficult area, we're making some improvements in Patch 1.4 (Which releases alongside the first campaign expansion ) that will make the leveling process a bit more interesting. We're also making changes to Unit Shields so combat is more visible.

I can't make any promises on any other area but if enough people feel that combat ends up clumping too much we're always happy to take that feedback on board and maybe experiment a little with it.

In the mean time I hope you'll keep your eye to see what we do in the future, we've learned a lot of lessons from WFTO and we'll keep improving that and take the lessons we've learned into future projects!

Cheers,

Lee",230190

The devs have gotten a lot better with updates and they now have a test server for all to go and try and give feedback on updates in the pipeline. they listen to the feedback.

Ppl give out about matchmaking sometimes, usually coz they don't understand its complexity, a higher powerscore opponent only means they are less skilled than u and that they are being matched against lower powerscores to improve gameplay all round for everyone. 

Its a slow grind if u intend on putting zero money in, but it is possible to do it, with the help of crossoutdb.com for market work. it will be a few months before u feel like u have any proper progress happening, but if u can afford 1 or 2 middle of the road packs to start off, totalling say 30 or 40 euro, then u can get stuck into the proper grind early and use the market to flip ure coin as you go (be careful it takes some skill/experience), from there on its very possible to grind ure way to the endgame, will just take some decent time input (months to years!).

2. It is almost impossible to unlock characters besides now your first one. i get that it is f2p but this is way over the top for difficulty. At least they added that you can see their moves in training, but the bot for training doesn't work.

3. This adds more into the character thing. Getting the currencey is nearly impossible because you have to get a duplicate from a crate that takes a bit to get for the lack of a reward in them. You should at least be able to sell legendary items that you get for currencey or do quests or even just from leveling up yourself or a spacific character. (it would also give more insentive to play other fighters)

These to me are the 3 big problems in the game. There are lots of smaller problems, but they don't hurt the game to badly. Hopefully sense this is in early access the unplayable lag gets fixed and they do something to help with getting characters and rewards for free. I really like this game and see potential with combos fitting together nicely and the game flow being very smooth when it isn't lagging, but for now i will have to rate it a thumbs down until it is fixed.",1532401430,1532401430,False,1,0,0.0,0,False,False,True,False,,1532629115.0,"Thank you for the review!

It took me about 16 real life seconds (on full time warp) to pass 1s in game.

So that answers the question if devs have optimized the game engine.
NO. They have not. They have instead managed to make it a lot worse than before.

We are sorry the game does not seem to live up to your expectations. However, I would like to point out a couple of things related to your review.

First of all, the game is measurably faster than CMANO ever was and the code has been optimized significantly. If you are not seeing this reflected on your end. Please contact your support team (support[at]slitherine.com) and they will help you assess the situation.

Secondly, I would like to point out that CMO has vast improvements over CMANO. Both from a UI/UX perspective and when it comes to the fidelity of the simulation. A full breakdown can be found in the link below.

Gameplay: The mini-games based on equipment you wear were fun and even if you find them tedious you can skip them with the story mode option in the options menu which is nice. Although i think since it doesn't have a description in what it does ""Story mode"" should be replaced with ""Mini-games"" on/off switch instead, because it isn't very apparent in what it does without experimenting if you only have ""story mode"" to go off of when figuring out what it does. Unless there's more to it than i know.

Graphics: The Art and ambiance of it is awesome all around except the background which is moderate in some places and the character art is to drool for. Much better than most visual novels i've played. 

Story: 
I like all the characters since they got good depth to each one. 
The story has a few good twists to it. 
I'm not a big fan with dialogue systems based on morality because its so simple and generic but they used it quite well in this game so i've got no complaints on it. 

Stability: I came across 2 bugs where once i got attacked by the random goblins in that pumpkin room then after the battle the UI didn't come back so i had to manually quit the game. The other where i had finished a battle at the end of the game and it got stuck at a black screen so i had to manually quit there as well. Didnt happen again with either thankfully.

Summary: Its a great game overall and i heard this was made by three people which is impressive so i look forward to AGL Studios future endeavors in the gaming industry.

Its not the best of reviews, i know that but i do hope it was somewhat useful.",1573839919,1573841180,True,24,0,0.7182564735412597,0,False,False,False,False,,1573874274.0,"Thank you for the nice review, you should do more often :)

Having said that, I stand by everything said below and hope to see improvements. 

As it stands right now it is a downgrade from T1 in every way.  It's basically the exact same game but worse with slightly changed graphics.  The most fun weapons are gone.  A couple of the new ones are decent, but most aren't worth using.  The helmet and armour are gone so all you get to loot are weapons and shields.   You end up with so many useless weapons that you need to travel back to the merchant every single floor just to unload garbage because there are no longer merchants on the floors.  You now have to carry the key so blocking or attacking drops it.  This makes you unable to block in certain circumstances so you take damage.  Regen is gone as well, so again you gotta travel back almost every single floor to heal.  The Zaerie is now the most troublesome enemy.  His HP is crazy high and just walks through weapons.  It also gets stuck on corners leaving you no way to kill it.  Which leads to the biggest issue.  The balance just sucks.  You need to manage your upgrades between health and attack.  Cool.  Except you can never get your attack to a decent level unless you ignore health altogether.  Most of the game is spent very slowly chipping away at enemies.  It's boring as hell.  Then take one hit from poison and game over.  I was so pumped when this was announced years ago.  Then it looked as if it was never coming so I didn't get too hyped.  Suddenly here it is!  and it's a massive disappointment.  Do yourself a favour and grab T1 on sale and have fun for hours and hours.  Leave this alone in the hopes it gets playable at which point I will update my review.  Straight up biggest disappointment in gaming for 2020.",1607788306,1649274907,True,0,0,0.5465196371078491,0,True,False,True,False,,1609112251.0,"Hi Boogs, thanks for your review.

Tallowmere 2 is very much Early Access; not everything is in nor complete yet.

More weapons are coming. Will be looking at bringing back some weapons from Tallowmere 1.

Item and inventory management will be getting an uplift in an upcoming version.

Will be looking at ways to make key-holding more enjoyable. Wanted to try something new in T2 compared to T1, but realise there's room for improvement here.

Health regen is scarce – perhaps too scarce. Will look at increasing its roll availability in v0.3.

Enemy health – yes, many comments are saying enemy health scales too high. Will be investigating and making some number changes for v0.3.

Zaerie AI – will look at improving their behaviour.

Damage & Poison – Will be investigating this for v0.3 as well.

As a general disappointment from the announcement years ago – I hear ya. A good two-three years of my life during Tallowmere 2's development has been spent suffering from the onset of a chronic autoimmune disease, which has slowed my development right down (constant pain, feeling tired all the time, unable to think straight – doesn't help when trying to program). Only in recent months, specialist doctors have finally found a medicine that works on me with a positive effect. As such, T2's development has been much slower than desired. But things are looking brighter lately.

So, onwards from here. I will make improvements to the game. Thanks for your patience and feedback.",655740

 Pros - Graphics, explosion physics, maps, gameplay are great. Reminds you a lot of a fully customizing Twisted Metal. The game is a blast... If you have HOURS to dump into it or money to dump into it.
 
 Cons - While I wouldnt call it ""Pay to Win"" I would call it ""Pay to Progress"", you start with the bare minimum, get thrown into battle against bots a couple times, have fun, then get hit with someone who either has money to burn or a lot of time in the game. You get minimal in return for playing the game, it is a HUGE grindfest to achieve something as simple as a new weapon, cabin, or wheels.

 The game was pretty healthy when it launched in '17 hitting 10k players retaining 6k on average, now it averages between 3k-5k on a good day.

 New players are forced to buy one of the packs, just to be able to have a cool functional vehicle in battle, and if they are unfortunate enough to not be able to spend spare income, they play a few matches and uninstall.

The atmosphere is excellent, being a post-apocalyptic setting that does not feel as used and abused as the label. The reds and browns feel fresh despite their lifelessness, the barren, blasted landscape seems alien rather than cliche, and the ruins impart a sense of history, the sensation of a world frozen in its last moment as the sands and rust slowly consume it. 

The inverted parallels with our own society I found interesting. The way revelations wove disparate elements together was also great. The story was touching, with the opportunity of a best ending but also *choices!* and *consequences!* that allow one to explore other paths. It won't completely change everything, but enough to not feel arbitrary. 

I did not feel it was too short. The pacing was right, it was a complete story, and everything was grounded in the overall narrative. If absolute length is a concern consider it a novella, short yet satisfying.

The game is fun there is always something to do (if you pay).
Lots of items 
Team oriented in a good way its awesome when you can get randmos to help you complete a difficult quest

Cons: 

Pay to play. 
After level 5ish you have to pay in order to continue on with the story. And unless you want to spend god a lot of money on crowns you can unlock the worlds 750 per relm or pay the monthly subscription. I think what they should have done is relased the whole game at a flat price but theyre a greedy company so we get what we get.

Terribly optimized. 
I have a gtx 1060 3gb which runs this 10 year old game at about 10-60 fps (1080p on low) whereas mondern AAA titles run smothly at 60+ with medium to high settings.

Worlds are saved in a temp flie (i think)
I hate the fact that the worlds are not saved on to my pc. I recently tried playing this at a different location then my house on my laptop and had to ""redownload/reload"" all the relms, then when i got home they had to reload again. Im not sure where the world data is saved but i believe its a temp file. 

I do enjoy this game (and will continue to play) but would not recomend it unless you seriously want to play. The actually free part of the game is about 30 minutes-3 hours of game play (depending if you do the side quests and if you skip the dialogue). After that youll have to pay to do anything else.

We recently released a significant free update to Pathway with ""Adventurers Wanted"". I think quite a few of the issues you had with the game have been addressed in this update.

We've reworked the loot system completely. There are more events and combat has received significant reworks.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the performance and stability of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development from our two-man code team. 

As an early access supporter, you even have the first expansion for free, and the second expansion was free for everyone! 

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

The Visuals of planets or the feeling warping in to a sun feeling your whole screen to flying through the rings of a gas giant with nothing but you and the emptiness of space there is nothing more spectacular.

I loved elite I really did, I still do but there is just one thing that I just can't stand anymore with it and its the Nerf's the endless nerf after nerf to credits Core mining was amazing I loved to do it hearing the asteroid explode and the ship rumble and creak to the cockpit glass freeze over if its icy. I loved to do it and the credits where worth the risk of blowing yourself up if your to close. the Cores you needed where hard to find sometimes but was exciting when you found one as it was a gold mine but not anymore they nerfed it as it apparently was to much credits and wasn't just a little nerf no they killed it and the fun with it.

Then they nerfed other things as well and it just keeps happening then comes the cost of buying ships its ok to start the prices are reasonable but once you get to buying the larger ships then and the cost of fittings the price goes from this is fine to hell no. but hey have fun grinding 24hrs a day 7 days a week from months to get anywhere don't get me wrong there should be some work to get there but its a game and it should also be fun but it used to be but after the nerfs it isn't fun anymore its just work very grindy work FDEV seem content on nerfing things but not boosting anything. 

So this is where I stand with elite dangerous. I love it and it will always have a special place in my heart but I can't recommend it and as things stand the future isn't positive for this game unless the devs choose to boost profits or something else to make the grind less boring its not getting better its just not fun I have all the ships I've travelled to the centre and back but I still want to play for fun but it's just not worth it. I hope they can sort this out but they keep catering to the minority of the player base who enjoy the grind and its pushed alot of the other players away and with the latest release it seems the devs are giving up themselves slowly.

I really recommend it for cheap as a tourist and to just experience how detailed it is but be warned it is very, very grindy. its the most grindy games i've ever played but also the most detailed.",1666622409,1666623544,False,1,0,0.0,0,False,False,False,True,,,,359320

Some criticisms moved to the bottom as they are no longer relevant, so that anyone who's reading developer's reply would understand the context more. Any new comment will be marked as ""new"".

TLDR: Amazingly realistic tennis game for any tennis lovers. Well worth the price. Use the Maxou MOD. Developer is great.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have been a passionate tennis player for 10 years and this is by far the most realistic tennis video game I have ever seen / played in terms of the positioning, timing and strategy. Everything matters here just like in real life; the realism makes hitting a good shot to get out of a bad situation satisfying, making silly mistakes frustrating. I clap in real life to applaud my opponent when I lose to a good shot - this is how realistic it feels. Also, any tennis lover would sincerely appreciate the realism in the different hitting styles the game shows, although ultimately I believe these do not relate to the stats - you can hit a ground stroke with continental grip and still generate tons of top spin if your stats are right, so to speak.

Overall, this is  the best tennis game that has ever existed imo. It gives you the feeling of playing tennis and you have to respect how the control is on a gaming platform. I trust that once I get used to the mechanism on volley and player movement it will be all fine, ultimately no game can be exactly like controlling your own body. And this is what the game is all about - understanding how it plays and improving your skills.

Graphic is quite bad and you won't find you favourite players here, but the mods solve most of the problems. Some players might want more ""gaming"" features like ""super power shot"" or mini-games and they won't find it here - this is tennis and that's it.

Another good thing I like is the difficulty setting has many sublevels - I don't even know how many - but everyone will find one that fits their level.

Bottom line: amazing game for anyone who wants a game that feels like real tennis. If I knew how the game plays before buying, I'd happily pay $30 USD for it, $45 if it has funnier game modes to add some variety. Creator of the game seems to be a very hands-on nice guy too.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New comment:
Tried the Maxou MOD recommended by the developer. Movement feels way more fluid than the ITST MOD I was using, certain balls you can actually chase them like Murray / Nadal etc., and you get way less ridiculous wrong foot (see my original criticisms for context). Volley seems to feel better also somehow. Another thing I like is the ""winner speed"" they show in this MOD. I have no complaints about the controls so far because this MOD solves all the problems I had.

This MOD is last updated in Dec2016 so the graphics aren't as good as ITST's, and the sound when you hit the ball is quite bad to be honest. You can very likely improve these if you MOD harder but I don't bother to yet.

I typed a long whining section about players' stats in this MOD as a joke but it ended up being longer than the whole review - just make sure you check and tweak the stats to your liking - Monfils' speed is 61 and Murray is extremely OP - with overall 90+ stats in FH, BH, Serve and Fitness. Some players (i.e. Tomic) shouldn't exist anymore but you can keep them around with all stats at 1 as a joke.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original comment on the Mod I used:

The mod I've downloaded (ITST) gives the latest ATP players with updated stat & clothes, but it made it impossible for me to play career mode and doubles or connect with any other player so I can't say much about those things. Another small complaint with this mod is my Federer does his first serve with a backhand grip which probably explains why I keep losing against Djokovic and why my eyes bleed so much lately.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original criticisms:
One downside for me is the lack of clarity in how the timing of clicking each button interacts with each other - e.g. does holding the button longer when serving change anything? What about the time you click the shot button? Does it matter whether you click up / left first, or together, or release one before another? It's intuitive to pick up the game, but when things happen you're not sure whether it's due to the minute differences in your control or RNG. This makes improving your skill in the game harder than improving in real tennis. The most reliable thing you can do to improve is better positioning and choosing better shots. This leads to a big issue for me in playing volley since nothing I do seems to give me a high quality shot, and I get frequently passed by shots that are fast but clearly within my striking zone. My only net points won are when I seriously drive my opponent out of the court - I have less confidence in my volley than when I'm playing volley against three opponents in real life which I hate because volley is one of my favourite elements in tennis. Arguably though, this lack of clarity creates certain ""superstitions"" as to how you click what buttons would create different effects, which I occasional find enjoyable...because sometimes feeling what you've done means something is more important than it actually working.

Another control-related issues for me that I dislike the most is the mechanics behind player movement. I believe the main basis of movement here is momentum, considering how you start very slow and run faster the longer you keep going towards one direction, and very difficult to go to the opposite direction; this is realistic in terms of how you can get wrong-footed and how you can chase balls. The issue is the game doesn't differentiate your first step with other steps. Any tennis player would know how split step allows you to jump start your motion, or very quickly shift your body weight to the opposite direction (e.g.shifting your weight to your left foot then jump to your right hand side for a forehand). This does not exist in the game, which makes change of direction unrealistically unforgiving - you step to the left by 1mm but the difficulty in going back to the right side is as if you have been sprinting to the left - and I got aced by 2nd serves quite a few times because I try to split step and ""adjust my balance"". To be fair this is likely caused by my mental habit of leaning left and right in real life and the movement buttons represent actual movements instead of shifting balance. Still, it would be ideal if these mechanisms can be included, or create a sprint / jump button so that sudden change of direction is possible, even though punishing.",1580888524,1580986671,True,3,0,0.548872172832489,3,True,False,False,False,,1580918504.0,"Hello, I'm going to try to answers the questions raised in your review. :-)

0) But 1st a little disclaimer : the ITST is a very nice Mod, but it changes a bit the gameplay and thus some things don't work exactly as I intended them to do ; I don't know it well enough to tell you this or that exact point is because of the ITST Mod, but it might be worth to try out the game without it to check it doesn't do better in some of the points you have exposed.

I can recommend you the Maxou Patch instead which does the same thing, but for the World Tour instead of the online mode (so you can't play online with it), but without the gameplay changes (except maybe for a few courts, as each one has its own physics parameters).

1) So the main thing to understand how works the game (especially at the net!) is to play in the Training Club -> Warm Up mode, after have activated the Danger Zone and the Aiming Preview through your Preview setting in your Character Sheet.

2) Like this, you'll see that the earlier you prepare your strike, the more accurate it gets and also the longer or shorter, depending on the type of strike

3) You'll also easily see that aiming left/right too early will send the ball out, and that releasing left/right makes the aiming zone quickly comes back to the center of the opposing court, so it's better to time your aiming so you never release left/right before striking the ball

4) The service works in a similar way for the aiming, but there's no accuracy involved, so pressing the strike button early or late doesn't influence the quality of your serve

5) The documentation explains also all that and many other things : https://www.managames.com/tennis/doc/Tennis_Elbow-Tennis_Game.html

6) The game does consider your 1st step, and gives it a boost ; moreover, doing left/right will also gives you a little speed boost like it does in real life (ie: your player will convert some of his speed to the right when starting to go to the left) ; but you have to do it really very softly, because if your speed is above the maximal convertible speed then you'll get wrong-footed as you have noticed (IIRC, this is where it might feel the most different in ITST from the original game)

7) Your connection issues are likely not because of the ITST Mod, but because of your router or your firewall requiring some configuration (check the doc for more info, and here for a few tips: https://www.managames.com/Forum/topic8-9923.php )

8) And if you have other questions, I'm usually around ! ;-)

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

The game is still in Early Access and in development so there a lot of improvements still to come as well as more content, gameplay and polish. We are currently working on a complete UI overhaul which will address much if not all of your concerns.

However some of the information you are looking for is there already. For example, you can open the villager list from the bottom left menu and sort this list by happiness. This will allow you to find unhappy villagers much easier.
You can also hover over income and expenditure in the budget window which will give you more detailed information.

That being said, the current UI has always been a placeholder and all of this will be improved with the new UI.

I've played their games for over 7 years with their consistent weekly releases, their communication with the community is top notch and I supported the kickstarter but I'm not going to sugarcoat my words. Unless you like playing unfinished games, or just like testing things out and helping the developers grow the foundation of the community from early access, I'd not recommend it as it is in very, very early stages of development. Beta will last for a long period of time (I'd say 4-6 years if they even want to compete with other games in the market and with their limited resources) from what's here and needed to be worked on. As the game adds content to convey what to expect from the full release the review will change dramatically as the game itself.

There's a lot of work to be done. In the state the game is in it's really, really boring and sucks quite frankly. I don't even want to play it. But I have if you look at my hours. Probably even more if you count pre-beta and unaccounted time on mobile. I'll say one thing quests are like this:

Artix: ""I need bone dusts"" 
""Need more"" 
""I'll never be satisfied no matter how many skeletons you kill"" 
""Lol, you're still going at it?!?!""
""Keep killing skeletons""
""Here...kill some shadow wolves""
""BACK TO SKELETONS!!!!""
""Great work keep it up, now more""

Also getting a group for dungeons is horrible. There's no queue and you literally will be joining dungeons that are halfway or more done already. Therefore wasting keys. And progress in the dungeons don't affect everyone so if one of your teammates goes around killing everything without you you will have to use another key everytime for a new run to make sure you attack the monsters. You can only invite people if they are your friend which is dumb. And even with that said, the party system doesn't even work like an actual party system. Monsters feel way too powerful and makes the grind and questing even worse. Additionally, your player character feels absolutely underpowered during the grind to 15.  After every battle, resting and potions would be required as if you're fighting a mini boss. And that's literally just one field monster. You'd need a group of players to make it feel less of a chore.

One major issue though though AE, AQ3D is not AQWorlds. Do not bother to push out any further crazy cash grabs business models like in AQWorlds. Hell, I'll admit I've spent too much money for me to quit in AQWorlds but it ain't no pay to win MMO. Everything is for fashion only. HOWEVER, remove the Pay2Win microtransactions to skip farming materials to obtain the gears right away from this game. REMOVE IT. Focus on the MMORPG aspects of its 3D counterpart. Make it an MMORPG. There's no need to follow a similar guideline as its 2D counterpart. AQW is more of a fashion MMO game with RPG elements. We need an RPG like those are your single player browser games but evolved and something people would expect in the years to come. And please just because the game is also on mobile as well...don't think you cannot do as good as other MMOs in the market. Though, it's the mobile part that worries me if it affects development for this game making it a crappy mobile mmorpg on PC. Even if it's a good port.

However, per the dev reply on this review, it looks like they are some kind of placeholders for the early access phase that will be invested in closer to launch. While I would still advise anyone who is concerned about achievements etc. to be aware that this game _currently_ has some pretty bleh achievements, the game itself does seem like it has solid potential (though probably is best played with a bring-your-own-friends mindset, or solo for speedrunning, as the matchmaking population is small at the time of writing). It's comforting to know that the game itself is being prioritized over relative trivialities like achievements, but that they aren't just going to be a slapped-on afterthought to tick that box.

== original review ==

Potentially a fun party game but I'm not recommending this due to the thoughtless achievements. It's always disappointing when they boil down to a mindless grind and Fling manages just that. All achievements are essentially a series leading up to 1000 matchmaking wins. A race probably takes about 2 minutes once you get the hang of it, meaning you're looking at 30-40 hours of playing matchmaking to claim that achievement. I've not seen very many party games have that kind of lifespan, and this one clearly isn't one of them - I've tried matchmaking a few times and gotten no randoms to join. They recommend a Discord server in-game to go find players, but I'm not interested in doing even more work to play a game. 

More thoughtful, skill-based achievements or at least more reasonable win targets for the grind based achievements would go a long way towards the image for me. (If you're just slapping on bad achievements, it makes one wonder what other corners were cut for design..)

Based on the gameplay I did go through, it's probably not a 15$ game if you have to have each person in your group buy it. Maybe Remote Play Together would benefit there. I got this as part of Humble Choice (Dec 2021), so not sure what a good-feeling price point would be. Would probably need to experience how much variety, etc. is available; I'm just not encouraged to do so by the current achievements.",1639327564,1639371893,True,1,0,0.0,3,False,False,True,False,,1639331561.0,"The game achievements are something we're committed to changing for the better before the game leaves early access, I agree they need some work right now.

OLD REVIEW
All my problems with the game are equally balanced with the things I liked.

I can't recommend it, because I just didn't like more.

Credit where credit is due, the 'witty sidekick' is actually funny, and that can be really hard to do.  He is surprisingly not annoying.

[b]TLDR: yes it's good once you get into it, but it has quite a steep learning curve and it will test your frustration! [/b]

This game is very challenging, there is no hand-holding and can be quite frustrating in the beginning. (Your character miss majority of shots, while enemies seem to crit-hit constantly. Every fight will have the odds against you more or less).

My first character build was useless, so I had to restart with a new combat oriented one. It was still hard, but manageable. [i](pro tip: prioritize 1 weapon, not multiple. Also, Jack-of-all-trades might not be your best bet, as you'll quickly realize you suck at everything instead. Specialize in a few things, let your Partymembers cover the rest)[/i]

Initially I thought this game was close to Fallout 1-2 and XCOM series. But both those games are much easier compared to Colony Ship. Then it hit me, this game reminds me of Planescape Torment. Its atmosphere, moody music, story telling and difficult combat; [i]now I enjoy the game. [/i]

The game works almost like a puzzle-game in the sense that I could not progress in certain storylines, and had to find sub-quests / fights / things to lockpick / steal to earn enough EXP or money to improve my party. After a while you get better and fights you thought you were never going to beat, were suddenly very beatable. In a sense, this was quite rewarding. 

The art, music and writing is all very good and I enjoyed those aspects the most.

There are a lot of things I'd like to see improved, but since this is Early Access I have no doubt they'll be addressed in the future!

Currently there's only 1 chapter, but it took me roughly 12 h (with a restart)",1619301736,1637795080,True,6,0,0.5582329034805297,0,True,False,True,False,,,,648410

I still really want to love this game because of what it wants to achieve, but instead i find myself in an unhealthy and abusive relationship with a game that constantly rapes my hopes and dreams. I start it up every now and then and try my best to find the spirit of the dungeon keeper series but it simply isn't there. The campaign seems like something that the developers just wanted done quickly. Every level is about rushing. There's no planning, no lovingly construction of your dungeon, no clever use of traps or spells. Only; get creatures -> plant rally flag -> win level -> repeat. And it really sucks because of all the other work the developers has put in this game. It overflows with GREAT ideas, AWESOME effects and simply a cornucopia of tools that beckons your inner evil overlord to come out and play. BUT HE IS BLUEBALLED EVERYTIME BY THAT FEKKIN RUSH MENTALITY!!!!

As a bonus, your ""home realm"" in the campaing still suffers from a bug that teleports your creatures to the bottom left corner of the map, making them unable to be picked up, and makes the level inacessible when you try to re enter the level.

___________________________________________________________________________________

*Old review*

To many bugs, i am currently unable to complete lvl 4 due to the game CONSTANTLY crashing and making savegames corrupted...

I backed this game in the very early bedrock beta. Loved the ideas it had. Loved the potential. And in all fairness, the developers did a great job to carry on the spirit of the GREAT dungeon keeper. 

HOWEVER!!!!! Why on EARTH! would you leave the level design to a guy with utter and complete claustrophobia!? The levels does in NO way encourage dungeon building as much as it promotes a kind of shabby colony expansion on islands where every ""room"" (if you will waver your every definition of what constitutes a room) has its location and usefulness pre deciced FOR you by the shear lack of land to develop on.

Furthermore...whats the use for reinforced walls in your dungeon when a normal dwarf can plow through it in seconds with NO way to save it...

I would love to see this game ressurect my favourite game of all time, but first the game has to be playable...",1428239412,1442344456,False,2,0,0.5222896337509155,1,True,False,False,False,,1530633868.0,"Hi Kamicarden,

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game. We have added so much content that the install size has more than tripled to a still tidy 5GB! 

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. Two of these are completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Cian

Not sure how, but I managed to not know of the existence of this game, let alone the fact that it's a cult classic - so I launched into it with guarded curiosity, and I was completely hooked in a matter of minutes. The setting, the low-res but very atmospheric visuals, the haunting music and then the excellent writing and no less excellent voice acting drew me in for the opening act like few other games ever did.
While the first act in the wasteland was almost perfect, the second one in the city was less so. There were two things that didn't work that well:
- The game wanted to tell too much backstory compared to the gameplay. This resulted in text dumps, more of them as we approached the end of the game. They were interesting, I would have liked to read them as a novel - but this is a video game, not a novel.
- Several puzzles were opaque to the point of WTF-ness. I may have enjoyed them in the 90s, but now I simply couldn't find the patience to tinker with them all. May be the game's fault, may be mine, hard to tell.

Overall, i feel the pacing is too slow unless you run at 2x or 3x speed, then it seems about right. 
The game appears solid in it's early stages but once you manage to stabilize your initial settlement, there aren't a lot of huge challenges. It really needs more end-game content.

*I have completed the game, with 18 hours of play time at the time of review.* 

In one word?: Yummy! 
Would I recommend it?: Yes. 

[b]Pros[/b]
- There is lots to upgrade! 
- There are a few different ingredients. 
- I love the variety of recipes - you can bake so much. From simple bread loaves to buns, doughnuts to baguettes. 
    - Each bakery product comes in a variety of different recipes, too. I hope you know your cheat day muffins from your magma buns! 
- There are lots of different machines. Nearly every machine can be upgraded. 
- You can customise your kitchen to your liking. 
- EXP gain isn't too hard, but not too easy. There is a medium grind. 
- I love the textures for things in this game, especially the doughs. I dare you to add pumpkin seeds to everything. 
- It is moderately difficult not to run out of money, whilst also making sure you don't run out of ingredients. I like the element of challenge this adds. 
- I do like the TAB menu. 
- [spoiler]You unlock new bakeries to work for as you go along.[/spoiler] I like that. 
- The recipes you unlock get progressively harder and lengthier as you go along. 
- It does become a challenge to balance your time correctly! But not annoyingly so. 
- I [i]love[/i] the ""pluck"" feature. I wish baking in real life was that convenient! 
- [spoiler]The ""completion"" cutscene looks like something out of FNAF, and as a FNAF fan, I'm into that. [/spoiler] 

[b]Cons[/b] 
- Everything about the driving. It's so janky and controls very poorly. 
   - Why do the other cars lose a tire when you collide with them (which is inevitable?). Also, why so many roadblocks? Are the other cars as janky? 
     - Yes, this can be forgiven, as driving isn't the main focus of the game. But it is a key gameplay element, which means I really can't not mention it. 
- There's no setting to hide the UI for screenshots / no photo mode. 
- [b]Distinct lack of repeatable tutorials[/b], aside from the initial one. I feel like an improvement would be to add one for each machine, and maybe each time you go to make a different style of baked product for the first time. 
- Parts of the text overlaps when you go to order ingredients. It makes the text unintelligible. 
- I would like more ingredients to play with. 
- I feel this game would benefit from more baked goods. Tarts, more pastries, etc!

TLDR: At this stage the game is laborious to build, rewards/requires afk-ing, simplistic and is just really easy for for veterans in this genre. Wait until it gets better (hopefully?)

I have been eagerly awaiting this game because I love these genre games and I've always wanted a good hotel sim.

 paused the game immediately and started away but boy was I disappointed in the first edition.


Building walls was fine but I ran into my first problem with building a set of windows I wanted a row of full length glass across the front of my reception like I see in great hotels... they just didn't fit like I'd expect, no biggie, early access and all but everything about trying to move them was just so clunky. After a half hour of googling and trying stuff, I ended up selling them and just settling for simple windows.

I liked the option to build to a grid, only the grid it builds to isn't the grid on the screen.

Then came building my first hotel room, I built the bedroom and a separate bathroom. There was this option to add a bathroom to the bedroom but I couldn't link them, I tried everything and ... another half hour later... I don't think you can link them. So I named the rooms ""Room 1"" and ""Room 1 bathroom"" (more on this later). I still hadn't started the clock (but oh wait, the clock starts automatically for some unknown reason as I then discovered - paused again.) 

After meticulously creating my room, adding furnishings colours etc. I was happy with room, even with the limited furniture it was nice. I liked the amount of swatches and even though some of the building was clunky, not too bad at all. Then I went to copy the room ... another hour gone, nope not possible.

2 hrs in I was yet to start the game but oh well, I'll just suck it up and build stuff manually. No you can't edit the size of rooms, for some reason the outside is considered a room, naming rooms is done twice, one of them shows up in a list, the other doesn't but not in the order you would think ... I don't even know what these are for?

I hired staff, they just work 24hrs and I never had to look at them again (except I upgraded them each time I unlocked a star - dunno if it made a difference).

... and this was pretty much where the game-play finished.

I just built some rooms, fast forwarded until the next star, built more rooms with the new stuff, fast forwarded etc. Most of the time, I was watching YouTube or out of the room because there is no reason to monitor what's going on. If you are used to these types of games, you know how to build good rooms and all my guests were always happy and left good reviews. I have never had a bad review.

As you unlock stuff in the game, there are fewer and fewer items and it really shows that this game still lacks a lot of content. I think adding multiple floors will also add of lot spice to the design aspect of the game (please tell me there are elevators as well as stairs) but it really is a massive hole in the game at it's current stage.


What I would like to see in the game:

I want to see guests that have personalities and quirks like hates or loves windows, big or small room, needs to be close to a toilet or close to a vending machine, that would encourage us to build unique rooms and also cater for special circumstances.

I would love to see like events such as corporate groups who require a free meeting room, school groups whom all require the same floor, or separate floors for boys and girls and a teacher for each with bunkbeds for the kids.

I would love to see family groups, with games-rooms for the kids in a safe/monitored area.

I would love a convenience store that can be visited by the public and guests.

... We need a pool, this is a given, but also an Onsen

Different styles of restaurants for the guests personalities or those who like variety Japanese Teppanyaki? Luxury? Seafood? Bistro?

Other services like hairdressers, massage, (airport?) shuttle, butlers, valet, porter, room service


I really want this game to be good because I strongly desire a good hotel management game but right now this is far from it. I really hope the devs can achieve what we all hope this game can be.

Pro's
+ nice swatches 
+ saving swatches is great (although see negative to this)
+ building walls/rectangle rooms is easy and great
+ connecting the kitchen/dining works seamlessly (this a pro because it's the only rooms that connect properly)
+ it's in early access ... so I give the dev's some leeway

Con's
- the game is expensive ... it's a risk paying this much for what you get
- editing rooms is not really possible
- copying rooms isn't possible
- multiple floors isn't available
- furniture/doors/windows doesn't snap to the same grid as the walls
- creating a connected suite isn't possible (a bathroom isn't connected to a bedroom if they are walled - wtf?)
- there are no events, so the game is just make profit and AFK
- very few items/rooms in the game
- guests/staff feel lifeless without a personality (maybe like speech bubbles at the very least)
- only single guests ever come? (why have double beds?)
- the disco room (the flashing floor is just ... no, it ruins any theming and is just annoying on screen, can't we have a nightclub instead with options?)
- too easy for veterans of the genre
- shortcuts stop working, game requires a restart to continue
- key mapping isn't available
- seems like there is no punishment for having a negative balance?
- game loses saved swatches when restarted
- no colour-pick/rgb etc. for swatches
- can't lower/invis walls
- placing objects in different rooms render them unusable e.g. a dining table and chairs in a bar will never be used
- loading your save loads an older autosave instead of your most recent manual save",1633605475,1633896768,False,0,0,0.4782608747482299,0,True,False,True,False,,1657014654.0,"Hello,

Sorry to hear that Detached makes you feel uncomfortable. We try to warn all the players (also in the game description here on Steam) that Detached is intense game and it's not suitable for everyone. Especially for players with nausea problems.


I would like to remind that we prepared few control schemes for each controller (Touch controllers, Gamepad, Keyboard). You can choose the best one, which can be more recognizable from FPS games or VR. Player can also enable steering assist or Eagle Eye View to limit field of view in the most nauseating moments (pitch, yaw, acceleration etc.)

Start building. Cannot find Cobalt. Start again. Do this +10 times.

Get through first video dig holes and build equipment.

Get to second video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrDI1_MAokE&ab_channel=Splitsie

Grind down everything and start building. 
Connector does not fit. OK....
Dig hole for connector. After a day, get connector fitted.
Drill does not fit. Ok....
Spend hour trying to get the drill to match the front of the ship.
Have idea. Follow the rest of the video, move the ship to different location and try fit drill there....

Build Cockpit, build engines. Fit engines. Engines run. Ship does not fly.
18 hours on the game and more hours than that spent in forums looking for answers..  
Ship still does not move.

Uninstall game.

Be prepared to get frustrated for no reason at all.

I continued to play their games for a while now. 
I've sunk a stupid amount of time in to this game. 

Artix Entertainment has a cheeky identity to its games and a recognizable style that makes the player laugh and cringe at the many puns, references and wall breaking jokes. None of that is delivered in this game or any of their games for quite a while. 

This is just a grind. You can't pay to win, which is good, money is mostly cosmetics other than the 1 time subscription payment. But the amount of time it takes to get certain items is easily comparable to other major MMO's with a key difference: THE ITEMS AREN'T GOOD, AND ARE OFTEN RE-SKINS. The amount of grind of items that quite frankly have no effort put into them is crazy for nothing in return. 

Basics like swimming, mining, dragging items, cursor changing when hovering over clickable's, minimaps, AN ACTUAL MAP, decision making, and so many other things are simply not included and seen as not important by the devs, who instead will sit there and feed you aimless quests, missing story and shotty random live events for gatekeeping players to talk about later to keep newer players trying to get the same items when it would take giving you soul to this game to get everything, like it taking over 100 level ups past max level just to get a brown re-skin of some armor you get in the one of the first areas. It's a joke.

Games like this are a reminder why you should never delve in to something or get look the other way because of nostalgia with a companies past products. It's a free game so I guess there's that but it really just seems like a money hole for people holding on to nostalgia and a mobile game for bored kids.",1685878267,1685878267,False,0,0,0.0,0,False,False,False,True,,1685909946.0,"Hey there, we appreciate your honest, in-depth review and your 611+ hours of time spent in-game.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. Two of these are completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate
- Entirely new Skirmish AI

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Cian

Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We have been reading and listening to player feedback since the 1.9 update was initially released and have since worked to address a number of balancing issues. In particular the 1.9.0.35 patch released on November 9 brought a large amount of balancing fixes that should hopefully have addressed the gold trickle and speed that you have raised in your review.

We will continue to monitor feedback from the community and will no doubt make further tweaks where required as we want the game to be fun and not tedious.

We hope that these changes rectify the slow pace that you found at the start of the game and hopefully we can earn a positive review in the future.

I was nervous getting the game, because it didn't look very appealing to me based on the screenshot but positive reviews convinced me to give the game a chance. Never regretted the decision.

Although the game is kinda short it's very fun to explore it. You have a chance to learn a lot about the lore of the game in the city in the info kiosk. Once you read up on the world, War of the Four Cities and Humanist religion you'll see that the game has a very developed world which shows through environment and characters really well.

Puzzles are also great. I wouldn't say they're hard but in some cases you'll need all your brain power to solve them.

The only downside that this game looks pretty bad  on a 4K screen. There are some setting to make visuals less painful and more sharp but it doesn't help a ton. Still it's playable and great story overshadows visual issues.

Overall I highly recommend the game. It's a great journey into the post-humans world ruled by the machines. Great game!

Now don't get me wrong this is a pretty good game, and if you liked the bureaucratic gameplay of that game then this will scratch that itch... To an extent. However its completely bogged down by superflous and completely mediocre gameplay elements that just have no real reason to be in the game. I'm a border control officer so why would I be driving around doing bloody tailing missions? I mean it doesn't make sense from a gameplay or logical standpoint. The constant phonecalls to go do some other random thing that has nothing to do with the border control is honestly annoying although mostly ignorable. I haven't completed the game so I've no idea if ignoring them has an effect though.

It's just not necessary. In fact none of the ""open world"" elements are necessary or even fun at all. It just detracts from the main gameplay and lets face facts this isn't a triple AAA game, the shooting and driving mechanics are severely lacklustre at best. So why they decided to force you to drive around (being ambushed constantly) and do these really out of place missions and busy work is beyond me.

It also detracts from the relatively rare moments that made papers please special. Like a dude begging to be let in to help his family but with a minor problem in his paperwork. This game does have that but so far I've had a lot more ""chase this guy"" ""go follow that guy"" ""go here and do this"" missions which, as I said, just feel out of place here.

I'm also REALLY not a fan of the vehicle inspection elements. For some reason I just can't seem to ever get them right. Finding broken parts of vehicles sounds easy but almost all the vehicles are rusted piles of crap anyway and its super annoying to have a perfect score ruined by a missing bumper that you had no idea was supposed to be there in the first place.

Now you're probably wondering why I'm recommending this game when I have quite a lot of problems with it? Well the fact is it is a pretty good game and doesnt deserve a negative review. It was released in better state than most AAA games and the devs seem active in the forums and are addressing at least the most egregious issues people have with the game. Namely the bad ambush system. So while I'm giving it a postive review I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. Basically i recommend it but don't expect it to become your most favourite game of all time.

It's like the opposite feeling I had from papers please. Where I expected to hate that game and ended up absolutely adoring it. I expected to love this game and found myself thinking it was ""just okay""",1678510972,1678510972,True,1,0,0.5378150939941406,1,True,False,False,True,,,,756800

We assure you it is possible, and not even that hard, to progress in Planetbase, as you can see by the numbers of people getting the game's [url=http://steamcommunity.com/stats/403190/achievements]achievements[/url], but it has some tricky mechanics that might take some time getting used to. 
 
Kind Regards. 
Martiño.

Although I haven't really read books or played other games on this topic, I think it does a pretty good take on the setting, enough so to spark some creative interest of my own.  The characters and full-game voicework are for the most part fairly well done but dialogue kind of falls flat in a few places, mostly because of the script writing and not because of the voice actors.  The story is fairly cohesive and events therein are weighty and interesting, but in a few places I feel like the scenes were not given -enough- weight.  This is especially true of all the alternate endings and post-game cinematics, which although included to give the player some logical options, needed a bit more fleshing out.  It is also interesting to point out, it is impossible to game over although some decisions can change your endings.

The visual aesthetic of the game is quite nice, as is the music.  While pleasant to listen to and not annoying in any way, none of the tunes were especially catchy or easily memorable, and in a few of the dramatic scenes a stronger musical touch would have gone a long way.  Sound effects are unfortunately fairly weak, lacking thematic when operating devices and having little oomph when explosions occur, and in some places the game seems bugged and plays no sound effect at all.  The voice work has a nice robotic emulation added, although some characters seem to exhibit multiple variances in recording quality or style that doesn't seem to be a character quirk.

Performance-wise the game runs fine.  Although it resizes itself and forces fullscreen (thus making dual-monitor setups a little wonky), the resolution is not a complaint.  I never had pathing issues or pixel-hunts (just me being blind).  The game interface is functional and unobtrusive, as well as autosaving.  There are some included commentaries as well in the options menu.

All in all, I really did enjoy the game despite some of its flaws.  Its not very expensive, and it's about 7 hours of gameplay for one playthrough, with low replayability.  The setting is done very nicely and the story is good, what's there to complain about is mostly some rough edges and needed spitshining.  It doesn't ruin the game at all.

So here we go why i dont recommend this game. 


1. So for starters this game was released SUPER buggy. it almost seems like it was rushed in development and they didn't get everything done/fixed. Like for instance on one of the chapters (i wont spoil it) my game crashed 2 times before we could move on from the puzzle AND when we tried to go back to our same roles they were swap'ed around completely! Also there are SO many spots where parts of the maps were unfinished and you could see threw the map and it ruined my immersion.

2. The puzzles were just lack luster and boring. the first few puzzles started out ok but then it just turned into pretty much the same puzzles with different formats. like ""oh this color makes this color"" or this symbol goes here"" it was repetitive and just overall boring

3. The story. The story in the last 2 games connected so well but the story in this just put SO many plot holes in the old ones. Like where did the old characters that made it go? what happened to them? what difference did there existence make?

4.No fear factor. the first game was so scary. you get this spooky cut scene at the beginning  that tells you the basics of how you got to where you are and that's it. It wasn't fancy or anything,and then you get into where you are and you pick up the walkiey talkey,you cant see or interact with each other so you FULLY have to trust him to be your eyes and ears threw the game and the weird castle. also it was super dark and eerie. You had SO much incentive to GTFO in this i just didn't have  that same incentive like ""OHHh im GOnnAa die owell"" idk how but the last 2 games did this way better. 


Now this all being said. Yes as a WHOLE the game was a decent game but not for the standards this story has set. the first 1 was phenomenal, the 2nd one was GREAT, and this is just meh. 




As it sits i dont think its worth 13$ i recommend waiting for it to go on sale. because it IS worth a play but at 13$ no. sorry this was so long and i dont want to seem like im completely bashing the game because im not trying to. Im just extremely passionate about this series and was SOO disappointed with this game. it really was a let down. anyways i hope they improve with the next game and i hope this review helps people decide whether or not to get this game at its current state.

what I liked so far:
The dev´s are carring, They answer questions/suggestions fast! That is a great thing!
There is a strategic depth:
-Lanes: every player has a summon lane and a shared ""attack"" lane, if u are dominant in a lane you can summon a backup
-also most ""buffs"" are ground based, if u put it in the attacklane the enemy might destroy it by taking the lane.
-there is a spell order simular to instant/interrupt in MtG
-picking your colour is balanced (u have 3 slots to pick, cards have up to 3 needed colours. So the ""strongest"" cards only work in mono decks, strong ones only with priorized decks and weak ones in up to 3 coloured decks. 
-you can freely pick summoner spells but lose HP for every one u take.

What I dont like:
-ranked battles are the only thing to do after the story
-depending on daytime you have to wait quite some time till a battle pops up
-there is no NPC mode /just story that gives you differnt tasks (without standard situations)

While it's interesting, it's semi-unique and enjoyable from the engineering/programming standpoint, the game lacks the basic concept of actually being fun. 

There's zero, in terms of story to be told and there are no characters to keep you engaged or caring about. ""Ok then, there are other game like that, that are quite enjoyable though!"" you're thinking, I bet. Other games are like that and I have enjoyed many of them, but many of those games have an overall ""character"" to them; be it in their design, art work, theme, etc. Nimbatus vehicles, however, are just a bunch of dull two-dimensional blocks with flashy lights that do stuff.

The building is repetative and ""monotone""; you simply take similar parts and move them around in similar ways to get the desired effect. You can simple make a square for everything and get the same results as any other ship. There's no reason or incentive to make anything more complex than that. And beyond the same handful of similar ""missions"", the game gives you no reason to expand your ship building abilities.

It has no unique art style that grabs the eye. It has no meaningful characters to relate to. It has no immersive atmosphere to keep you engaged. Other games have that going for them, this game, though, doesn't.

Best I can say, is that it is to this very niche genre, as Avorion is to it's equally niche genre. They are both games that techncially do everything right, down to the core mechanics, but both are games that lack any real ""flare"" in terms of their gameplay.

In addition, the game is very ""simple"" comapred to other titles in its price range. For instance, BeamNG was in the same price range when it first came out, as a tech demo. However, that was a pioneer in soft body physics, never seen before in any other racing/driving game. Nimbatus doesn't pioneer anything new, or add incredible features to an already stable design.

This game would have best been left as a tech demo for a much larger, immersive Adventure/RPG style game.",1538771098,1538771098,False,11,0,0.5042473673820494,0,True,False,True,False,,1587654780.0,"[edit]
Hi Lizzard

We're now done with the early access and will release the game in three weeks. Quite a few things you mentioned we tried to address over the duration of the last 1.5 year. We added a story, a challenging survival mode with part unlocking and much more. We think we found quite a unique twist on the building genre, so we would love to hear back from you if we succeeded with that.

If you try the game again, please tell us how you like it now :)

Performance is still below my expectations based on my hardware vs. the requirements/recommended specifications, and I imagine much of that is due to the game engine. I will continue to play and enjoy WftO!

Original review below
=============================================================

""Mixed"" would best sum up my feelings of this game. I had fairly high expectations for this after playing another recent dungeon simulation release, and I was unfortunately disappointed with poor performance. It seems this game was too ambitious for the developers, with more potential than anything else. 

Performance in the menus is always poor, while performance in-game degrades to the point of nearly unplayable.  After several crashes and reviewing the logs on my own, I found entries such as:

[code][Coherent GT] (Warning) Coherent GT: Performance warning on View 0 View drawing time (Paint() call - CPU time) is high. The execution time on graphics API is in ms. Threshold value: 2 Detected value: 20.377 [You can customize this warning][/code]

There were other similar ""warnings"" which makes me think I must rally fewer units at a time, otherwise the game crashes. My system far exceeds the requirements and recommended specifications so, while I should not need to, I followed other recommendations for dealing with crashes (disabling [b]Screen Space Ambient Obscurance[/b] and [b]Anti-Aliasing[/b] as well as running on lowest Texture Quality - 12%). 

After continuing to dig, I found I could adjust game speed, which came with a warning that increasing the game speed could increase CPU load. Since adjusting the game speed [i]down[/i], crashes have become a lot less consistent. 

Additionally, so much of the game is locked away in DLC (higher total costs than the game itself!), there are disappointments everywhere I look.  

That said, while WftO does not meet its promises, it is fun to play.

I've not played a lot of Point & Click games, and those that I have, weren't anything like this.

Since it's been so long, I'll just give a short and sweet version: [b]This game is f#@king awesome.[/b]

And I'll be honest, I absolutely suck at the kinds of puzzles and half the problem solving that was in this. I needed a guide. But just as honest, I don't care that I did. I'm glad I did. The story, theme, setting, just the entire tone of this had me dying for more. Several months later, writing this, remembering the best scenes, I STILL want more. I want a series of novels. I want a mini-series. I'll even take a movie. Hell, this game felt almost like all of that somehow as it was. I still get chills thinking about it.
The voice acting, characters, settings, all fantastic. Favorite side-character was definitely Ever Faithful Leobuilt. Spooky and fascinating, full of a lot of information. Best creepy robotic voice I have ever heard, and I love it. I wish I had a text-to-speech reader that sounded like him.

I'll say that this game is incredibly depressing, bittersweet, and and a bit nihilistic in a couple ways if you're someone looking for hope for the future. Even The Good Ending of this game still had me contemplating how long anything might keep existing. But... there was so many unanswered aspects of the world lore, I can't do much but keep wondering.

My only negatives are probably that some of the puzzles were impossible without a guide, and that, as other reviews have written, it seems to raise more questions about the world than it answers. And I guess I'm... sort of okay with that. Although, I'd rather read a series of novels set through the history of the world to learn more.

Goddamn, I love this game. I'm going to have to replay it again soon. lol

It feels like a competent update but the magic isn't there and the frustrations push it over to a no for me. Really I was looking for more than an update to the old game.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. Two of these are completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Cian

So, it really isn't a surprise when the class system in aq3d mirrors that of aqw. For those of you who haven't played aqw before, aqw is a web browser mmo game that has no class lock, the same as aq3d. As long as you possess the class armor, equipping it gives you access to all skills of that particular class. No class lock and instant access to all skills to 3 different classes?(mage, warrior,rogue).

Sounds good in theory right?It looks like a ton of variety until you look at the classes. Each class has 5 usable buttons. The issue with this is that 1 of these buttons is your regular attack and another is your buff, which leaves you with 3 buttons to button-mash. Not a whole lot to work with, and very demotivating when you realize that these skills aren't going to increase even as you level up, nor is it going to grow in potency as you level. You start off with the same 5 buttons from the moment you equip your class armor to the end, because Artix Entertainment(the company behind aq3d) knows how best to have fun; by removing skill trees and removing player choice.

Combat. Battling with monsters is an unimaginative, boring, repetitive grindfest. Monsters have no weaknesses, discernible attack patterns, or special attack mechanics that you have to look out for, something that good mmos always have. Aq3d monsters are essentially simple auto-attack creeps with differing hp values, which makes gameplay so simple that even a 3-year-old wouldn't have trouble with it. Coupled with the barebone skills system, aq3d's brain-dead combat system is perfect for its target audience; brain-dead aqw fangirls.

Graphics. To be frank aq3d's graphics pale in comparison to many mmos that have been ported over to the mobile platform. The majority of people who actually think aq3d's graphics are good have never or rarely played mmorpg games, or are aqw players who are stuck so long in the 2d web browser world(of aqw) that 3d is a huge upgrade for them. It's like a blind man seeing the sun for the first time; everything is beautiful.

Equipment customization is largely cosmetic. None of the equipment has any special effects or set bonuses you see in mmorpgs, nor does it have any slots which you could socket with gems. Aq3d equipment provides the same kind of stats in mmorpgs( attack, crit, evasion, armor etc), but does nothing more. Itemization is a bland, horrible experience that you would wish on your worse enemies.

To sum up, aq3d is an archaic, repetitive,player choice-neglecting game that might have worked if this was the 20th century. Unfortunately with the advances in technology, aq3d pales in comparison to any half-decent mmo game out there. Gameplay is stale, simple, brain-dead and its design is catered to the converted; namely aqw fangirls.",1527199363,1527199363,False,4,0,0.5176470875740051,0,False,False,True,False,,1527256951.0,"Hello!

The game is a blanancing act of ensuring various resources/needs are appropriately distributed and an error in that ration and knock the colony off balance and kill everyone. I'm enjoying how the difficulty progresses and the order of priorities gets ever more important.

If you were a fan of games like SimCity, the old versions that were actually fun, then you'll probably enjoy Planetbase.

I've tried many times to get through it all but once again I just feel like I'm pushing myself to get through something I'm just not enjoying. In fact, I'm moaning constantly as I play it...the further I get, the worse it gets....

I've never gotten past the second chapter as the game always manages to exhaust me and bore me. It just goes on and on with plain, boring level after level. The enemies start off pointless and then out of nowhere the difficulty spikes right up making all action sequences annoying and zero fun...

The level design is just bizarre and messy. Very ugly and no fun navigating them. A lot of them are just so bespoke and odd I wonder how they passed testing...

Enemies/AI are just a pain in the ass. Most fights are spent sat at a door way killing off anything that tries to walk in. Walking into big rooms with a lot of enemies is just suicide as your guns never do the job and enemies take way more ammo to kill than they should. Having big enemies tank your damage whilst a flying thing shoots acid at you alongside a tribe of fast moving plebs either shooting a pistol or a shotgun or even just trying to get up close and melee you is way too much and overwhelming to enjoy. 

Special enemies suck in almost every way. They take far too long to kill...

Random events at the end of a battle sequence suck in almost every way too. Some of them are bat shit crazy!!!

Performance is still bad with most busy areas dropping from 60fps down to 40fps or even 30fps. 

Guns are OK but the mechanics mean experimenting and building a good load out is just never gonna happen. 

Spent a lot of time thinking ""What the hell is going on??!"" or ""Where am I meant to go?!?""

The game, as a whole, just feels like a big old mess and whilst it can be fun for a few hours...extended game sessions just feel like work. 

A shame...it has potential to be something cool...buy in a sale and keep your expectations low

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the performance and stability of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development from our two-man code team. 

There is also now the second expansion, the Crucible survival mode, that was free for all! 

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

***Edit*** That was September - it's now January. There have been no updates, no road-map, no nothing. Apparently, ""Early Access"" is code for, ""We need to at least make some of the money we spent on this back without telling anyone we abandoned it""

***Edit #2 - Feb 24, 2024

Thanks for responding, It's been a little over a year and I've read your notes. I haven't played this since Sept 2022, so I hope what has been released is enjoyable. I am glad I was wrong about the game being abandoned, 

 Simply putting release dates with an area and a sentence is not a road-map it's a timeline. That seemed pretty thin to me as did some of the update and patch notes, but I can respect it as a stylistic difference and I certainly don't get to judge that. Fair play, I thought the concept was great and I enjoyed the character creation, skill-trees and the first areas in early access. The first 3 hours were deep, vibrant and pretty good. I remember stopping because it just was very thin after those areas and I didn't characterize your progress the same as you. I followed the patches and updates and it appeared to me to be very thin. However I didn't play it so I could be wrong and I hope I am. I wish steam had a pending review indicator. It's unfair to characterize this as thumbs down now, but I stand by it and what I observed then. 

 I see that the game has been put on sale in co-ordination with another update. I think I'm right about what's going to happen next but I hope to god I'm not. We've seen this before. Reading the patch notes I want to acknowledge and show respect for the work put in, I want to believe this has been a labor of love. You certainly make it sound that way. So if this update and sale is the last gasp of a game that is DOA instead of a road ahead, then I say vaya con dios, good luck and thank you for your hard work. I hope it's the start of something instead of the end. I hope i'm wrong and you find a way to make me eat it. I hope when I check back in six months this game is still being updated and then I will fire it up again and hope.",1664589588,1708788148,True,0,0,0.4751159250736236,0,True,False,True,True,,1671810145.0,"The last update was released on Dec 6 (new content and major system update).

Cannot recommend.

Negatives:
-Flasks breaking just randomly, and/or on their own
-Positioning Flasks to pour from one into antoher is too finicky
-Pouring is way to unprecise and too fiddly
-Ingredient prices are very over inflated
-""House cleaners"" don't even clean out all the garbage (leaving bottels and boxes)
-No mentionable soundtrack, monotonous sounds

Game breakers:
--Missions failing sometimes(often) even if the mixture has all the traits and properties required
--Jumping and bumping around because of random props (also causing flasks to break!)
--Can pour even more liquid into full flasks and loose it that way?! Why?! (see pouring too fiddly)
--Many (like a metric f-ton) spelling mistakes, wrong grammar, wrong interpretation/display of apostrophes (') all over the place
--Too much stuff floating and crawling around to distract you from the game (like dust and cockroaches everywhere, even after having the cleaners do like nothing for their money)
--Continously getting interrupted doing stuff, like carrying a flask, from pop-up messages (Which also mess with your controls resulting in breaking flasks/spilling liquids)

Something Positive:
+The game didn't crash on my PC yet...
+No real graphic issues like clipping or wrong/missing textures
+No stuttering/performance issues for me

The community is already so much better.

Chillout also uses the Steam age to make sure kids don't have access to mature content via DLC which is genius. You also have a LOT more options for filtering out what you want to allow or not... for example you can specifically say you don't want to see any flashing from worlds or avatars OR jump scares. 

Game is free with a paid version via DLC for creators that allows for unlimited uploads. Uploading of avatars and worlds is also basically the same but just with a different SDK in Unity which oddly enough offers MORE customization options and seems easier to use at the same time.

The concept is really  good, and the availability of different survival items is reasonably well balanced--yes, a bad run can easily leave you without the items you need to survive past the forth (out of six sections), but in general, it's just the right side of encouraging you to be careful with your resources without being frustrating. So that core gamplay is pretty solid. 

However, there are many ways in which game seems to lack polish. Puzzles are randomized, which I like, but it feels like a huge missed opportunity not to have at least a little randomization in the story itself. Sleep triggers the monsters, but what if something else did, and you didn't know at the start of each gameplay what it would be? But no, the monsters and notes you see in each section are set, so once you've seen them once, you know exactly what to expect on the next playthrough. With the exception of a few puzzles, there is no point in reading notes a second time. In addition, there's not a lot of flexibility in the way that you play. Once you've figured out the optimal play style, you pretty much just do that robotically, with perhaps some small adjustments depending on the characters you choose. Taken together, this severely limits the replayability of a game which is meant to be played several times. However, the *fatal* thing for me are the occasional game-breaking bugs, like a building suddenly failing to be warm even though it was warm before and the furnance is lit, or a character who is dead magically being resurrected but not fully functional (a sort of in-game zombie). Bugs push this game over the challenging threshold into not being fun anymore.

It's overall well polished and solidly put together, and it has a couple notable improvements over Beat Saber. However, most of the things it's done differently don't actually appeal to me personally. It's clear the developers have a different idea of what they want in a rhythm game than I do.

Broadly, if your primary interest is in fitness, and you want to be moving constantly and hard, but you're not that concerned with extremely challenging gameplay that pushes the limits of your skill and coordination, then PowerBeatsVR may be the game for you.

If you want a game that really pushes your skill and coordination to it's limits, and also tends to get you moving a decent amount, but more as a side effect than a main focus, then Beat Saber will do you better.

In short, I think PowerBeatsVR is a marginally better workout, but Beat Saber is substantially more fun and challenging.

Now, into the details, the things I liked...

- It's pretty. I like the environments and effects. It's nothing ground-breaking or cutting edge, but it definitely looks nice.
- No-loss mode by default. I don't understand why rhythm games insist on booting you out of a level when you're doing poorly. Just let us get a really low score! Doing badly at a skill level you're not good at yet is the best way to get better, and it's kinda demoralizing to have to turn on a special ""no loss mode"" that doesn't score points to do it.
- Calorie counter. For thus of us who play rhythm games for exercise, this is really cool to have!
- Better-than-average music. It's nothing amazing, but in a world where rhythm games (including Beat Saber) tend to come with a bunch of middling-to-bad EDM, this was refreshing. (Note: Beat Saber now has a number of official DLC music packs from some very good major bands, like Imagine Dragons and Panic at the Disco. But PowerBeatsVR's core music is still better.)
- The hit detection is solid and feels really good. This is something a lot of VR rhythm games struggle with, including the earlier versions of PowerBeatsVR, so kudos to the devs for getting it right.

Now, the things I didn't like...

- By default, the notes come in at a weird arc, making it very hard to judge where you need to put your hands to hit them. I missed a LOT when I started. Thankfully, there's an option to make the notes come in on a straight path, which makes the game MUCH more playable for me! Give the curved paths a try, you might like it, but I'd recommend digging out the straight path option.
- No color matching. You can use either hand to hit any note. This limits the complexity of the arrangements, as it can never make you cross your arms. You'll barely notice at the low levels, but if you're used to playing games like Beat Saber on Expert or above, you'll find their high level arrangements simplistic by comparison. This is the primary source of my complaint that this game does not really challenge your skill and coordination all that hard. Because of this, I was able to drop straight into Expert mode on my second song and do alright. The skill cap just isn't that high.
- Often when you're not hitting notes, it decides to mix it up with a pair of light paths, and you need to hold your hands on the paths. I found these bits honestly really boring. It's not that it's easy, exactly. I missed on them often enough. It just never feels like I'm doing anything awesome or powerful. It doesn't feel like dancing or combat or anything, and barely even feels attached to the beat. I'm just kind vaguely waving my hands in front of me for these bits. I'd almost rather they had me doing nothing.
- Some notes require you hit them a lot harder than others to be considered a ""hit"". This creates the awkward dynamic that a lot of the time you TOTALLY hit the note, and it presents the visual of being knocked down, but it doesn't shatter and appears to still count as a miss. While it's great to encourage the player to hit the notes harder, cause it keeps you moving and adds some challenge, it seems like it'd be better if it just did what most other games in the genre have done: Give you a score multiplier based on how hard you hit. Instead, you get a moving threshold on whether it was hard enough to count. Cases where you hit, but not hard enough to count, is kinda hard to read and seems frustrating and unfun.

So, overall it's not a bad game, but it's definitely not the rhythm game I wanted. Your mileage may vary.",1574917474,1606620818,False,24,3,0.6271153092384338,21,True,False,False,False,,1574941827.0,"Hi Aubrey,

thanks for your feedback. We are sorry that you weren’t satisfied with the experience and would like to do our best to give you an overall positive experience.

As we are already working on some bonus scoring for excessive hit velocity, I guess you would also like to have a bonus scoring for big motions (as we are already tracking those). Is that correct? And would you appreciate a tooltip somewhere mentioning that the required minimum hit velocity increases with the chosen difficulty?

Regarding the color matching: We decided to go without color matching, as we wanted to give the player more freedom and achieve a certain difficulty by implementing a fast-paced mechanic, adding challenging obstacles, and making generous use of the given playspace. We know, that some players would prefer color matching, some don’t. So I guess, we’ll have to gather more feedback.

Regarding the collision detection: We thought that we had achieved a reliable collision detection based on previous players’ feedback. But, you seem to have some issues with it. So, it would be great, if you could give us more information. What VR headset are you using? Did it happen in a specific environment or in a specific situation? Which quality level had you chosen? Every detail can help us.

Thanks a lot,
Team PowerBeatsVR",810500

It's a top down, mecha combat game. I want to love it, but I just can't.
Great concept, bad implementation.

Poor grammar runs rampant within the game. Whether it is the tutorial instructions, description of items, even in the achievements.

Speaking of the tutorial, it's Broken. It will get to a certain point and then just stop, never to return again. I even tried it on another account with the same result. Although, unlike other reviews, I find that I can still play the game as normal despite it not working properly.

Controls are a bit clunky, as is the GUI.

Combat runs a bit slow, yet you can be instantly killed. In fact, you can be dead before you can even start playing, due to someone camping the spawn point, which you can barely even tell from the map. As a whole, the game is very unbalance and very much geared toward P2W & veterans players that have grinded it out (higher lvls equal better armor & damage).

The mechs themselves and the options available to customize them all look interesting, but the grind to get and build most of them are seemingly far beyond a casual gamer. And I certainly can't recommend anyone spending actual money on this in its current state. -Fortunately you can still collect a lot thru daily tasks and free loot crates provided by them; including mechs.

The game only has 2 (3 now) scenario modes. Team deathmatch and a 'king of the hill' type of base capture battle played on perhaps 4 different maps.  -Recently added a Capture the Flag mode (though no instructions are provided for new players to know what the goal is).

All this said, I will still continue to play this more as it does scratch that mecha itch that just isn't available elsewhere, despite the game's issues, namely because it is free.

Really annoying, had to resort to using my mouse software to override the default sensitivity in-game. Also, there is no control mapping screen.

Thank you for your feedback, we always read users reviews and take them in account to improve our game.

Although you can build most small structures at the beginning, the metagame changes quite a lot later on: you will have to optimize your base for a larger amount of colonists, build bigger domes, deal with intruders and tend to radio transmissions among other things.

Also once you master the first planet you can try out the more advanced ones, as they have different starting condtions, weather patterns, disasters and higher difficulty over all, especially the Storm one.

Additionally we've also recently added the new Challenges, which are tests that let you approach the game in a different way.

Overall the game is designed for about 20-30 hours of gameplay, which taking in account it's $20 price tag should hopefully be reasonable value for money.

Regards.

Being Early Access and from a small developer I wouldn't want to pay $50 for it, but it's worth at least $25 and it seems to never be that high.  Kudos to the dev for not being greedy.  I really hope you try this game because its quite amazing.  Also, if you haven't played in a while, take a look.

I'm not sure what's occurred here - we've not used product keys/Steam keys for about 18 months now. If you purchase on Steam there's no reason to ever head to the Frontier Store for any reason. Is it possible you purchased from a third party vendor who didn't provide the redemption instructions?

The dumbest in any game I've ever played. Even something as simple as removing units from groupings requires you to drag it down several times in the grouping screen and even then it's 50/50 if it works. There's also a bug that obnoxiously shows the ""System Power"" icon which then blocks most of your view of your units and buildings, good luck navigating with a blocked view and buggy AI.

PATHFINDING. It's not there. Choppers will hug buildings. Units will forget orders. Vehicles ordered to dock and resupply will run in circles. 

Wonky building placement. Debris and structures can't be cleared but a forest worth of trees and a small nations worth of cars are easily removed via landscaping tool. Also can't select MULTIPLE buildings, something so basic in RTS games. 

Devs are killjoys. Decided to make game harder for the sake of it being harder. Gotta play the game the way they want it, never yours. Added turret cap when the AI pathfinding is a horrible mess. Good luck trying to get your drunk units into the fight. Also posted paragraphs of mental gymnastic to justify their decisions. You can't limit player choices when your damn AI doesn't function, that's why everyone was turret creeping. Lost so many chokepoints because the AI couldn't find it's way around a garbage can. The map also has a ton of wide open spaces which are impossible to defend with the limited turrets and unit cap. You'll be forced to speedrun the game instead of planning expansion. 

The Main menu is a horrible mess of ADs that Zuckerberg would be proud of. There's links for the devs youtube and other pages. Why not post your Instagram while were at it. Might have had an epilepsy looking where to start the game. It's like a tile of social media apps.

There was an update recently, that was touted as a super-big-deal, so thought I'd give it another try.  Unfortunately I'm experiencing the same issues.  For example, it says to place a town centre, but to be careful where to place it as it can't be moved later.  IT DOES NOT GIVE ANY OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE ARE GOOD PLACES AND BAD PLACES!  It give you a quest to build a manor.  It gives you the ability to choose a bunch of cool things to the manor like towers and chimneys and flags.  So of course I added those.  Only to find a few hours later that the manor cannot finish being built as those things require resources that I don't have and can't trade for.  Do they expect me to start this game again after several hours with a resigned, 'Oh well, never mind, I learned something?'  And then do the same thing for another two hours until I hit ANOTHER snag and have to restart it AGAIN?  We'll I'm not bloomin' doing that I can tell you!  Even trading is incredibly non-intuitive.  When they say, 'Sell all above this value,' do they mean sell-number-of-resources-above-this-value, or sell-each-resource-if-you-can-sell-it-for-more-than-this-value?  Later I got a quest to sell berries to the king.  I had the requisite number of berries.  But the dumb game never told me HOW to sell them/complete that quest.  Not even in the help thing about quests or trading.  So yeah.  Still incredibly frustrated and still feeling like it's a waste of time.  Some of the interface things look a little nicer.  But it's like staying at a hotel that have been thoughtful enough to leave a mint on your pillow, but you find the bed unmade and the shower dirty.  Note to developers: I will only change this review if you change the game dramatically so it's actually user-friendly.  It tells you what to do, (options when various paths work, disables actions that will make it impossible to progress in the game - for example it should not allow me to add things to my manor design that will make the building physically impossible to finish - and hence the manor mission physically impossible to finish, and hence impossible to unlock any other buildings and quests...) this should be right down to the 'left click here because [X], not there because [Y.]  It should walk you through the game with parts of the screen flashing to show you where you need to look and click (it told me to go to the Trading Panel, but it took me a long frustrating time to find the thing!)  It should explain what you're doing and how various actions will help or hinder you later in the game.  Still same review as below - too difficult to know what to do or to know what you're doing well or badly.  I've played sims and resource-based games for ages.  This is in the top 1% of frustrating games I've played.  Read my original review below.  It still stands.

Not enough information to be able to play the game.  Every time I want to perform even the simplest of actions, I basically need to go and read a few pages of information off the internet.  Which is not fun.  No intuitive.  You don't know whether your actions were good or bad.  You don't know how to make certain things in the game work.  You don't know what's going well or badly at any given time.  The in-game help is woefully inadequate.  It's basically a remake of the Setters game that came out like 20 years ago, except it's less attractive-looking, and far less easy to understand.  Waste of money.",1607930025,1625315807,False,3,0,0.4721045196056365,0,True,False,True,False,,1608648372.0,"Hi Golan Trevise,

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. Your feedback is very welcome!

The current UI is a placeholder for the new one that we are currently working on. We plan to release a complete UI overhaul next year that will go some way to improving your game experience. 

We also plan many improvements to the User Experience (UX) including a much improved help menu along with many features that will help to explain and guide you through the game mechanics.

There is still much more to come and we will release an updated roadmap early next year which will take us to the full release.

Hopefully with all the planned improvements and additions to gameplay, we will be able to earn a positive review in time.

-Fails to provide a sense of accomplishment or meaningful achievements

Let's look.
>> sounds are porly madeCreation of nice sounds for space game with such dynamic environment and camera - quite a complex task. It requires some time and will be improved later.
>> no control over ship at all
No control at all? :) You may control any modules of the ship. Setup any hotkey for any function. Setup resources connections, location of the modules, shield radius etc.
You have more control over your ship than in most others similar space games.

>> no tutorial at all (steam community guide after 2 years of development ony??)
Yes, this is very complex and unique game which requires a lot of research. Not a casual clone of existed game which can be made for a few weeks and which does not adds any new features after base game .
Celestial Command in constant development and adds a lot new feature which was not available before. Also we constantly improve existed features.
This is Early Access of Alpha version, so everything changes quite often. Any kind of interactive tutorial will be outdated very fast.
We will add tutorial at Beta stage.
At current stage it will be just waste of time.

>> GUI is not consistent in functionalities.
On the contrary. Any action have its button on the GUI. In additional, any button have its tool-tip with detail description of this button.
In our opinion, it is great. Personally, we are do not likes GUI in most games, because its interface provides very low amount of control elements and often without any tool-tips.
Sometimes, GUI can be a complex, but it related only to overall complexity of the game.

>> After 2 years of active development no progress has been made in core functionalities.
On the contrary. Very rare game have some much changes during 2 years of development as Celestial Command.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the stability and performance of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development in out two-man code team spent patching it up. 

As an early access supporter, you even have the first expansion for free, and the second expansion was free for everyone!

Thank you for leaving a review. 

It sounds like you have not been promoting your newcomers to serf status. Newcomers do not require housing so will not build houses. Once promoted to serf they will then require a house and will start building. There is an early quest that guides you through this process.

You will need a lord's manor with a great hall function assigned. Once you have this you get the chance to promote villagers at the start of every month. 

If you are using mods there could be a mod that interferes with this.

Cheers

I originally picked up the game when it first dropped into open beta and grinded up to level 17, just a bit away from the old max level of 20, killing dragons and working my nuts off to try and get a shiny gold cape which I'm still grinding dungeons for now... One thing that didn't quite get me back then was the humour, my god there are so many hidden jokes and pop culture references that I completely missed when the game first dropped.

I'm definitely not a critic and maybe I don't have the greatest experience in writing reviews, but what I do know is that I've put in one or two hours into this game and I still don't get bored! First of all it should be clear that noone should expect anything truly groundbreaking. There are different heroes and guardians and each one has its own little special features. Be it a tank that can also strengthen its group and taunt the enemies or a druid that can give the whole group a &quot;Heal over time""; effect and support it. Or maybe you prefer a mage who conjures the image of a dragon for a few seconds, which then fights for him? Furthermore, the game is constantly getting new updates, which add new content, fix bugs, change the animation style, etc. ! Finally, the only point I find really difficult to say: The game encourages you to buy advantages in the ingame shop. However, to be fair, if you don't want to fight for the first place on the leaderboards, you can get through the game relaxed without ingame shopping and never really have the feeling that &quot;You MUST buy something in the shop now or you won't get anywhere!

They have abandoned VR, which, I'll admit, is disappointing, but I would still play without it, if there was a solid game here still. The real travesty is a loss of vision. FD just don't seem to ""get"" why people play their game. They refuse to implement long asked for features and quality of life updates. Instead they put effort into a poorly thought out expansion that didn't even deliver the features most wanted for an ""on foot expansion"" (interiors of ships, VR, etc). I don't really see any of this being remedied in the next couple years. So with a heavy heart, I have to give up on this game. 

In 2017-2019 the game hit it's peak for me. But today there isn't enough here to be good, and what is here is tedious and sloppy.


Old Review:

I love this game. It's grandios, epic, humungous. It may be grindy, but it's fun. As a VR experience, it's incredible. You're there, in your cockpit, a pilot of the stars, just doing anything to make a buck and buy new stuff. Exploration, combat, trading, lore. It's all here and done so well.

Sure, there are obvious improvements that can easily make this game AAA, and it can be frustrating for the developers to not see how obvious they are. I can only hope in time it's realized, the developers are active and have future plans, even years after release. 

The community is great, but it's hard to be a part of that community without going outside the game. You forget you're playing online for your first 10-20 hours sometimes. But, if you go to Discord and Reddit, there is a thriving community of people to play and talk with that are just as into this game as you are.

The developers have tried to help with my connection issues, I took my issues to twitter and service tickets, and they seem to think the problem lies with me, but I play tons of games online, and have never experienced issues like I did in this game. So, they did try, but ultimately I still get connection issues pulling missions and doing other things in station. I even set my gaming rig in DMZ to make sure it wasn't a port issue and it remained. I changed to google DNS, same issue. But I've never really experienced gameplay lag. Dogfights are as smooth as butter. I know how to troubleshoot network issues.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2017. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. One of these is completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate
- Entirely new Skirmish AI

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Cian

i love this game and i recommend you to play it if you're a fan of charming worlds or boss rush games, it does these very well and it's a very fun adventure game.

what i DONT recommend is for you to 100% this game. ever.
spoilers ahead so read with caution.
popocity is so terribly designed and is the killer if your first 100% run, no matter WHAT. you will HAVE to 100% this game twice because of the event involving reaching 10,000 credits. when you reach popocity it's already around 8,000, and will tick up over time so even if you do nothing it will eventually reach 10,000. why is this an issue? simple, many events can ONLY be completed BEFORE it reaches 10,000 and (unlike most events) CANNOT be completed after you beat breevis. the worst example is the kneft invasion, which is where i lost my run. 5.5 hours in and i have literally done EVERYTHING ELSE up to this point, all i had to do was a couple of missions i knew could be completed after breevis, the fried kneft happiness point, and the kneft invasion. i had totally forgotten the kneft invasion was a thing and spent so long trying to get the bad kneft from fishing (nothing but good fish hooks, by the way) that the city reached 10,000. so before i went to fight breevis i figured i would take care of the kneft invasion. but for SOME REASON the kneft invasion GOES AWAY WHEN YOU REACH 9,999. not after breevis, which is what would make sense, but RIGHT when the city locks up. so if you take too long doing the mandatory events for 100% you are PERMANENTLY LOCKED OUT OF 100%ING THE GAME AND MUST RESTART. not to mention, i was playing on INSANE MODE. so if i want to get back to where i was, i would have to replay 2/3rds of the game all over again and make sure i did ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING on a TIMER to make sure that i didn't miss anything and would have to repeat it all over again. 100%ing this game is terribly designed and ruined all good graces i had for this insanely charming and fun game. if you play this game, for the love of god do not 100% it.",1631118734,1631194930,False,11,1,0.5580987334251403,4,True,False,False,False,,1644010996.0,"Sorry to hear you had such a bad time 100%ing it.

ive played this game periodically on mobile and on steam for a few years

i think the game could be really fun and interesting to play if it werent for the fact that everyone is pretty much the exact same aside from cosmetics

what i would do to make the game more attractive for myself would be to add some kind of talent system or specializations to each class to allow for one to build there own version of each class. I think its boring when you level up and there is nothing interesting or new going on besides being able to wear new gear.

also i think it would be cool to be able to have your own custom class which takes from each of the main class trees or whatever something interesting like that to allow someone to feel like they are really playing there own character that they made.

character building is fun and also id add some big bosses with interesting mechanics and some sort of huge battleground pvp with good rewards.

*First of all, the English translation is REALLY bad, and that breaks immersion very early on the story.
*The plot is shallow to say the least. Gameplay feels clunky and the interaction with the environment is not intuitive.
*The puzzles are pretty random, with no good reasoning behind them, so solving them is not rewarding, just relieveing. 
*Ambientation is poor. Game really needs some better sound effects and appropiate music to build tension.
*The ""monster"" is badly designed and not even close to being scary.
*The dungeon, which is supposed to be the spookiest place, had a pointless QR Code on a wall (which doesn't seem to work) and a picture OF THE DEVELOPERS with the text ""it's just a prank bro ;)"" after a long corridor. I think that's immature and unacceptable in the horror/suspense genre, and just breaks immersion (even more than the broken English).

I don't want to be unfair with this game since it was most likely developed by one or two developers with low to no budget, but I wouldn't buy it again. It wasn't fun, it wasn't interesting, wasn't scary or immersive. I played 20 minutes and got bored, with no will to finish it even though I knew it would only take 20 minutes or so more.

I'm sorry that you weren't impressed with the game back when it released in Early Access. Since then we've spent years working on the game and improving it up to a standard we're pretty happy with. 

To put it in perspective we've released over 80 updates since 2015, that number more than doubles if we include the early access period.

We released our largest patch 2.0 just a couple of months ago, which completed overhauled the game.

I thought you might like to drop in and give it a go. Also, I thought I'd let you know as an Early Access player you've been granted the Heart of Gold expansion pack for free.

We'd love to hear what you think!

The deep, varied, and strategic gameplay, combined with a strong visual asthetic and a dark sense of humor, make this game feel fresh and enjoyable, even on repeated playthroughs.  The devs still seem to be active, so we can (hopefully) expect more content in the future.  The online multiplayer and Workshop support should help tide us over until then.  Plus, there is a sandbox mode where you can create and grow a dungeon with virtually no limits, and then test it against waves of invaders.  I've speant an embarassing amount of time in this mode.

every now and then i launch this game (usually when im high) to see if it got better and it didnt. joshstrifehayes made an incredible video on this game and why it doesnt stick its landing. just fyi rn my character is stuck in that i cant find voltaire since i got TPd to battleon, but THERE IS NO MAP. as in i cant see where the quest is. im not an idiot i know i can look it up but even zone maps have so little effort put in them it frankly makes me not want to spend time on this game

We're sorry to see that the new update disappointed you. The idea behind this update for the puppets was to create a greater challenge and further enhance the moment-to-moment gameplay. We acknowledge that some of their functioning might not be as satisfying for all players, but we wanted to increase their threat, especially with their entry into buildings. The agility of puppets is also something that is specific to the lore of the game, meaning that they are not monstrous, decaying creatures like in other media, but retain virtually the same functioning as the living because of the BCU's controlled by TEC1. Also, the other reason this was introduced is because the threat of puppets was easily mitigated by entering buildings and now this is not an option as hey can open doors and enter through windows.

I like these kind of games, I really do. You know, there's a buncha games in which you can be Adam Jensen, but very few ones in which you can actually be his sidekick, his support: Pritchard. 
For those who don't know, Adam Jensen is the main character on Deus Ex: HR and Deus Ex: MD, a former swat agent turned into a cyborg dude who works like sort of a hired gun, and Pritchard, on the other hand, is a hacker.

If you explore in the first level on Deus Ex: HR, and you have a high-enough hacking skill, and/or one of those unlocker thingies, you could access Pritchard's computer, and there's an email, with a rejected idea for a TV Show, in which, the main the main character would be a hacker. The reason for the rejection, is that people don't really feel identified with the ""hacker"" and would rather prefeer a rugger, ex-cop turned bodyguard or something like that.
So, this game is basically Pritchard's TV show turned into a game, you won't be working in the front-lines, but actually, behind the screen, giving intel, hacking stuff, and commanding your squad across a series of missions, in which imagination is key, pretty much like it would be in a real case scenario were this things happen in real life.

Whilst I haven't really got immersed into the story at all, I thought the gameplay was intuitive and fresh, and pretty fun. At least for the hour or so I've played. But pretty much like the fictional producers in Deus Ex: HR world, I wonder, what's the core demographic for this particular game? Do people really feel identified with the idea of a hacker, hiding in the shadows, giving orders and support behind a screen?
That troubles me a bit. People whom I'd believe could feel identified here, would maybe be actual hackers, but the game doesn't really feature a complex simulation of hacking nor anything like that, it's actually more like a series of minigames. So, I don't know.

I didn't enjoy a single part of the experience except the visuals, once i got the settings sorted are quite nice.  can't realy comment on if the game play is good because the controls and game play were just too... I don't know not right.  I was frustrated right out of the gate just trying to get the ship to just go where I told it.  then the first training drone... that was even more frustrating.  

maybe this is just not a game for me, and thats fair but i can't say I reccomend it at all.

[Update]

I have changed my mind about the game, when I originally tried playing, I had been using the keyboard and mouse at my desktop.  and my original review covers my feelings on that.  However after getting a VR headset I gave the game a second try, first with an x-box game pad and found that I had no problems with the controls.

Sorry to hear you've not had a great time with the game so far. I just wanted to mention that we haven't provided Steam keys for almost 18 months, that's a legacy method of registering access so if you've got a copy of the game with Steam keys (either an old purchase or a third-party vendor) it can be tricky to get set up.

2. Gorgeous pixel art, beautiful locales, awesome score
3. Excellent cast of characters
4. Adequately channels some of that Indiana Jones goodness

Cons:
1. Shallow management mechanics; not enough character customization

we spent the last six months improving our game. 

Now that we‘ve finished our update 1.1 I can tell you that we have added 18 new special character actions, thereby completely reworking the skilltrees to enhance character custumization and overall progression.

First, the boring. Making money is trivially easy. Buy some ships, make some routes, set the buy/sell orders to ""standard"", and it's done. Things will be purchased and sold and you will make money without any intervention.

The tutorials are slow. Our narrator is a fine voice actor, but is trying way too hard to sound like a pirate and jabbers on for far too long. Many parts of the narration are unskippable. The game play is locked to 0.5x or 1x, which means you literally have to watch your ships slowly make their way across the sea over the span of a few minutes. The main tutorial takes over 2 hours.

The campaign isn't much better. You have to play Spain first. Spain wants you to trade items, ferry people, and build production. The town economies are a mess, but you aren't allowed to fix things until you appease them; in the mean time, they insist on producing things they don't need, or failing to produce things they need and could be producing. The campaign wants you to make a lot of buildings; far more than you actually need, producing far more than you could reasonably sell. They also want you to ferry 1000 people from the home town to other towns, but you can't automate this, so you have to babysit your ship as you move people to towns that don't need them. I was swimming in cash, had almost no control of any production (because I didn't spend my time individually shipping goods in short supply to each town to appease them), and I was literally just waiting for time to pass to complete the objectives. Yawn.

Now for the broken. So many things are either awkward or just completely broken. Almost everything is done through various dialogs, including interactions with the towns. Placing buildings requires zooming in, which is a bit of a hassle but at least makes sense. But buying ships and assigning them to convoys? Why does this require zooming in to the town and selecting various buildings instead of using a dialog like all the other trading/organizing? You use the same button to interact with a town as you do to order your ships to sail, so I regularly found myself sending my ship away instead of interacting with the town. The ships themselves often got lost behind the nameplates of the towns; I had to zoom in all the way to just see them. The mouse can be used to zoom in/out and rotate (who needs rotate?), but you have to use keyboard to pan the view: no click-and-drag like most games. Placing buildings would regularly cause existing buildings to be destroyed without warning, refunding the money for the land but losing all the trade items you just spent minutes delivering.

If you really want to play this like a tycoon game, good luck. You get some summary charts, but those won't help you to diagnose things. Routes and convoys will also give summary statistics, but there are no breakdowns to figure out which parts of the journey are working and which aren't. You can't see which towns require what or what your typical buy/sell prices are. You can't easily track or manage your town reputations. Heck, you can't even check what towns need while you are modifying a route! If the point of making a route is to get items to/from places, wouldn't you want to know what they have/need?

The ""filling level"" seems to be arbitrary. Some places had zero consumption but we below the optimal filling level even with hundreds of items in stock. Other times goods with small consumption would be ""full"" after having only a few days worth in stock, even if those goods weren't produced locally. There is no way to tell how much demand there is for something. You could easily find yourself buying a hundred of an item only to find that most places were ""full"" after receiving only a few of them.

For a game whose main focus is trading, trading is boring, confusing, and monotonous. There was no strategy and no risk. It was less engaging than playing Drug Wars. Buy some stuff, sell some stuff, automate it because it's boring, have more money than God, and now what?

Sure, you could be a ""pirate"" and make military ships, but for what? To sit and watch a counter tick down while you siege a town? Just so you can have another place to build more useless buildings? Or get into a fight and play a mini turn based tactics game whose biggest challenge is ""try to line up two shots""?

And normally graphics don't matter, but seriously, the graphics look they came straight from the early 2000s, right down to the low-res prerendered intro cutscene, the pixelated portraits for characters, and the incomprehensible mess that is the town hexes, where you can't even tell what they are without selecting each one (not even a hover-over!).

This is one of the most disappointing games I have played. I picked it up because several Let's Players I enjoy are currently playing it (paid, sponsored) and they seemed to be enjoying it, but they sure earned their sponsorship, because this game is a lot more fun when someone else is playing it for you.",1601246080,1601246080,False,91,3,0.8139928579330444,0,True,False,False,False,,1601308763.0,"Thank you for your detailed feedback.

Regarding the difficulty: Have you tried using higher difficulty settings in free play?
Especially with regional resources changed from „even distribution“ to „Regional distribution“ and trade routes from „with automation“ to „without automation“ make the game far more challenging and fun for experienced players. By default, the game settings are suited for beginners.

Please rest assured that the other topics you’ve raised will be discussed and taken into consideration for further improvements to the game.

Just like in previous games like ""Railway Empire"", we plan to work with the community for improvements and long-term support.

I also appreciate the throwback to the old Syndicate games with how the maps are laid out.

The campaign structure is a (long) series of missions and I would have liked a more linear and cohesive experience. In fact you don't really ever have to read the briefings or debriefings between missions. 

Controls could do with a bit of tweaking as well, the game picked up my x-box one controller just fine and will roll with it, but having to control both distance and direction with the right stick makes for an unpleasant experience. I would have liked for the game to turn on autoaim for distance, and had the crosshairs locked at a specific distance when using a controller instead.

Using the mouse for aiming works perfectly, but movement with the keyboard can get tedious, as you often have to walk diagonally.

Thankfully, almost all of these issues can to a certain extent be fixed in the settings. If aiming with a controller is hard, you can either alter the sensitivity, or lower the game's speed to give you more time. 

If having to press W and D at the same time to move diagonally gets tedious for you, change the settings so that W moves you diagonally (either left OR right).

So the solutions are all there if you have the time and inclination to experiment until you find what fits you like a glove.

In short: I really recommend it!

When a draught is expected, you must rush to prepare. Is everything in place? Do we have enough food? How full are the water barrels?! And if the draught is longer than we were expecting, how many of your beavers might die? The first time you lose a colony after meticulously planning out a lot of complexities kind of hurts.

The game currently has two factions of beavers, each with their own quirks and tools to tackle problems. I switched to the Iron Teeth beavers as soon as I unlocked them while still very new to the game and at first I found their lack of an irrigation tower technology for farming inland (away from your river) confusing and frustrating. I suddenly realized I needed to channel my own personal inner beaver and that is when the beauty of this game reveals itself.

Dams! Levees! Floodgates! By shaping the riverbanks, rocks, and creating frameworks of bridges and passageways, I could carry water anywhere if I was clever enough to get the logistics correct. Building aqueducts by placing levees as walls down the middle of my territory, or exploding new channels along ground with the beaver's dynamite tool to provide a more natural pathway for a stream, I am now a master of conducting water where I want.

This game, though fresh into early access has a fair amount of depth out the door. If you have a joy for games involving resource management, logistics, a pinch of that RTS genre feeling (though you can pause this one) then this game is a must buy. Games like Factorio, Dyson Sphere Program, and Satisfactory are my personal favorite kinds of games, so if you are also from that crowd, you should be adding this to your cart immediately. Yeah, it isn't about making a factory, but that same itch that those games scratch is one hundred percent baked into this game. 

Would I buy this on sale? Yes.
Would I buy this at full price? Yes. 

I put 500+ hours into Dyson Sphere Program and it came out about 8 months ago. I think my next 500 hours are all going entirely into Timberborn.

Two hands/arms: There's a specific feature that detects when the player brings the hands and arms together and modifies the physics model to better represent the intent of the player. It's not perfect, and we have seen that for some body types and VR setups this isn't detected properly. Going forward we'll adjust this to make sure it works better for people.

Ball goes far/short: By default, aim assist is enabled to make it possible for players of every skill level to play. The ball will be clamped to the play area so they you can't shoot it outside. If you are experiencing this with aim assist disabled, then it would be interesting to discuss it more.

Cannot go close to the net: Before players could go to the other side of the net. We talked with the players what we should accept. We decided that we should not be able to cross over, and we then keep the play area on ""your side of the net"" so you should be able to step forward to the net physically on your play area. If you can't, we can tweak they to let you move further.

Slow joystick movement: We have discussed this in Discord and decided that the movement should be faster. 

No settings descriptions: We have added more and more settings so players can tweak the experience to their liking. I agree with you that descriptions would be good!

Jumping is just teleporting: Some players have suggested that the jump should be a smooth animation up and down. Would that work for you, or do you have something else in mind?

Movement while jumping: in the beginning you couldn't move when jumping but players felt too constrained by that so we made it possible to move while jumping. Would you like an option to turn that off?

Volleyball rules: The fundamental volleyball rules are in place but there are a few things that we could add, for sure.

Thank you for the feedback, once again. I'd love to hear more so feel free to join us on Discord, or write a post here, or send an email to support@neuston.io

Have a great day! 🙂",599590

We use similar visuals and game design as other MMO's, but we are very different since AQ3D is inspired by our original single player Flash game AdventureQuest and the fact we have weekly releases. However, a 2D single player Flash game and a 3D multi player Unity game are incomparable. 

You can choose whatever classes you want and we do have an option to pay if you don't want to put in the time to actually work for and earn the classes. Cosmetics are completely optional and we have thousands of beautiful hand drawn items that you can get in the game, it's up to you and what you want to look like and there are countless choices.

Obviously it has some issues, sometimes the path finding is a little funky, both for your units and the zombies. Zombie ai is a little weird, sometimes certain zombies will just not do anything until you start shooting at them (Won't react to sound and such). I like that I can land troops on top of roofs, but zombies can't counter that, so it's a little op. I feel like the zombie faction should start out with more than what they have, as I was playing on normal mode, took over almost the entire map (Eventually lost most of it, but it gave me a ton of money) within 20 minutes, and was able to get 50k and upgrade everything within an hour. 
Very interesting tactic is to rush towards the Glenn Military Barracks and dig in there while securing the Southern island. I did this tactic on normal mode, and was able to accomplish a lot in just two in-game days. Because the military base has only one entrance, and the fact that you'll be surrounded, zombies will swarm it, allowing to cut down on the zombie population a bit.
A bug which I love to use is to spam turrets than place a generator. This allows you to have, theoretically, hundreds of turrets for just a few generators.
At the moment it lacks a little in content, but it's an early access. Game performance is a little bad after a few in-game days when thousands are infected.

Game's great. Would recommend.


---------SPOILER TERRITORY. SORRY I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THE FORMATTING---------


The story is fairly well written. It can be a little iffy at times when it comes to the grand scheme of things, but if you hold your suspension of disbelief, mainly the idea that someone could rise through the ranks like that and that you are pretty much the lynchpin for everything that happens in the story, it works well. I do wish that there were more outs from the story as time goes by, but you can only put so many options into a game before you start over-writing it. 
While I'm talking about endings, I'll bring up probably my least favorite one. One of the final endings is just one or two sentences and then it boots you back to the main menu. I get that they weren't trying to take a side in the underlying debate in the game, but it does seem a little strange when you have dialogue choices mean almost the exact same thing multiple times in the story.
I love how the characters are implemented into the story. On Day 2 meet someone who has your back. And that same person is with you until the final major decision. He's well developed and seems almost human with the way he's written, having real motivations behind his actions that are very relatable to many people. Almost every main character you interact with has an effect on the story if they don't straight up give you a way out of the story. For those that don't give you a way out, they still plant seeds into your mind. What those seeds may be will vary and what they grow into is up to you, but the fact still remains that they have really thought the writing out.
The mechanics of the game have also been very thought out. It may look like dots on a map when you first start out, but it quickly expands when you hover over that dot. A name and a picture along with a general location does enough to put meaning into a character that will be on your screen for about a minute. And then there's more information on the person once you click on them, information that will almost never have an impact on the case at hand. As you go through their data, it plants more seeds of doubt in the system. And then you have to click one of two buttons. Do they go free, or do they not go free? No matter what button you click, there will be text that pops up. That text tells you what happens to that person. Solely because of what you decided to do. The weight behind all that is monumental at times. It makes you question your decisions at times. And it is absolutely well done.
The commentary on the security/liberty debate is where this game really shines. By establishing a connection with someone who will be on your side until the end of the game, it ensures that the line for most people will be blurred. It's story is written well enough to have it come out to you at points and ask you if what you are doing is right and warns you that it's a dangerous path that lies ahead if you continue down it. As you keep climbing the ladder at the DoL, it's not just the people around you that starts to make you question the morality of everything that happens here. That's before you start to notice that the decisions are starting to become less and less mundane as time goes by. And as it all comes to a head, there's one question in your mind:
How much are you willing to sacrifice for security?
This question meshes in well with other subplots in the story, whether it be surviving though nepotism or just trying to live a normal life. You see people early in the game have moral dilemmas when they have to do things like authorize a new technology early or have to decide on where to take their career. Adds a nice bit of background to the characters you meet along the way.


---------[END SPOILER TERRITORY]---------


All in all, this is a fantastic game. It's entertaining, has a well-written story, and has a lot of deep questions that you have to ask yourself as technology advances in today's world. Takes a bit of time to complete. It took me about 16 hours to do my first full run of it. And it was 16 hours well spent.

Final Ratings:
Story: 8/10
Need a little bit of suspension of disbelief to get the ball rolling, but once the ball does get rolling it's hard to stop it. Excellent twist that you can just straight up miss if you're not paying attention.
UI: 6/10
Hope you like dots. You'll be seeing them almost exclusively. Does contribute well to the whole computerized atmosphere of the game. Sometimes Person(s) Of Interest (POI) get lost in the southern side of the map or in places that aren't really in conventional areas (looking at you Alaska and Hawaii). Sometimes the UI overlaps itself if you click a button too early and there's dialogue or if there's a POI on the eastern side of the map in the space between the phone and what the office around you looks like. Map scrolling can be annoying, so you disable it and then it's annoying that it isn't scrolling, so you re-enable it and the scrolling gets annoying again, and then you get annoyed that you have to toggle this on and off so you just leave it one or the other an deal with it.
Music: 7/10
Can get a little repetitive with some of the longer levels, but it's pretty well written. It's electronic style fits well with the setting of the game. Musical cues also help out in some scenarios.
Commentary: 10/10
Can't go into too much detail without spoiling a lot of the game. If you don't care about spoilers, go back up and reread the section that I start by mentioning the commentary.
Overall: 8/10
It's fun.",1625123368,1625123368,True,3,1,0.5358089804649353,0,True,False,False,False,,,,490930

This review is being written while the game is still in early access. When it gets fully released, this post will be edited as well.

Generally speaking, AQ3D is a nicely developed game with a few features seldom encountered (e.g. transforming into a mount instead of riding one) and while being in open beta, it still can be easily compared to other more popular MMOs. 

Although the game is good overall, there is a vast drawback that might be an issue for the AQ3D's future which is mentioned last in the cons section but, we still start with the advantages:

PROS:

- Beautiful Cosmetics

Probably the reason people mainly play and enjoy the game (including me). The designers have made an an outstanding job with a variety of cosmetics to choose from.

- All classes in one character

Currently, there are 9 classes in the game, which can be unlocked for free, except guardian which is the premium one. The most convenient part is all classes are playable by the main character and it's not the typical race-class format. Once it's unlocked, the players have access to the class which can be switched just by pressing a couple of buttons.

- Frequently updated

Like the developers have said, the game gets (almost) weekly updated which shows the amount of effort the company and members put in the game.

- Teleport everywhere

Apart from a few areas, the entire map is accessible through the teleportation system. The players are able to teleport wherever they want either from the menu, or through the portal located in the main city.

- Free-to-play

The game is entirely free-to-play with no pay gaps whatsoever. Supporting the developers is optional and by paying, it makes little to no difference for completing the main and sub story. It might take less time to unlock the other classes and acquire the guardian but the progression is quite the same for f2p players. It's more likely to be pay-to-look good than p2w.

Now that we have completed the main pros section, we will continue by including the drawbacks and, as we mentioned earlier, the last one might be the only major problem in this game.

CONS:

- Gear and item drops

These two are probably going together. Although the game revolves around cosmetics, acquiring gear from vendors might need a little rework. While gear can be bought or crafted by NPCs, the whole system is kind of unbalanced due to the fact that in most cases the required items have to be grinded, even though the players are able to find even better gear in the next area.

- Consumable travel form

That is most likely to be a double-edged sword. Although travel form is an exceptional idea, it comes with a price literally and figuratively. Travel form is a consumable item which transforms a character into a mount and gives the player approximately 160% speed which might boost a character's progression. However, the good news is, players usually obtain a few travel forms by opening daily chests.

- No end game content

Probably the major drawback in this game. Apart from lvl 31+ Noxus' return, when the players reach max lvl, there is nothing else to do whatsoever. Players log in to open the daily chest, rerun a lower level dungeon or in order to collect cosmetics.

While summarizing this review, I would like to pinpoint the last drawback due to its importance for the game's future. Unfortunately, this has happened before and it did not end up well. Games that had a massive potential, ended up losing almost all of its playerbase and eventually shutting down. Sadly, with the way games are evolving, 40-60 hours of gameplay and a lot of cosmetics are not enough to increase or even maintain the playerbase. Especially when it comes to MMOs.

This review tends to be more 'mixed' than yes but I'll post it as a yes because there is still room for improvement, the game is in early access and, it is literally free-to-play.

The Good:
+Can be run in LQ settings with a medium-tier laptop
+The airship combat leaves room for meaningful tactical choices
+Engineer/gunner jobs are somewhat casual roles, pilot/captain has the depth
+The leveling system is pretty. You get level ups pretty frequently to avoid the impression of being locked out á la some high-revenue games ( *cough League of Legends, CrossFire and Battlefront 2 2017 cough* ).
+It is not pay-to-win. Only cosmetics are sold. There are plenty of free costumes, so there is absolutely no pressure to spend extra money on this game.
+There are community events. Overally the community is pretty cool and non-judging even if you suck at the game. I haven't experienced a single griefer in this game.
+There is a lot of complexity in the ship and crew configurations. You can choose your TF2 style hats, items and special powers, rename the ship as ""Your Mom"" or ""You Are Adopted"" and pick some wacky guns for your ship. Very quickly you unlock half a dozen different ships, though the starter one seems to be in casual sense the best. No running through multiple decks for half a minute looking for that pesky balloon to repair on that one.


The Bad:
-The major battles can get unplayable laggy, to be point inputs drop like crazy and simple tasks like aiming with the gun and getting it to shoot reliably requires silly stuff like double-tapping and annoying levels carefulness
-It feels like a job and consequently attracts the MOBA flavour 3L1T3 PR0 gamers who view it as such and are super serious about winning.
-PvE aka ""CO-OP""battles feel like endless slogs are worsen the ""feels like a job"" impression. Killing in PvE is ungratifying as the enemies keep respawning at a rapid rate (often exactly behind the player ship that is awful for killing fun factor in many ways)
-PvP games are simpler and less dull, though there are much less players for that
-The feeling of windedness from 
-The min-maxed PvP tactics. Everyone picks the weapons that are most cheap and most damaging, killing the variety. I see a lot of fire weapons being used.
-The ""World"" i.e. the tabletop risk game where players dump their otherwise worthless ""war coins"" (!?) to advance the progress bars of their faction. It is boring busywork.
-The main gameplay is outright repetitive. For instance, an engineer repairs, guns and pilots, a gunner mostly guns and occasionally repairs his gun and pilot pilots the ship. 
-Trying to get the full view of the ship and its surroundings is very difficult, let alone navigating yourself to where you need to be on the ship. On some ships, it can easily take 20 seconds of dedicated moving just to get to a remote part of the ship to fix it. Did I mention the game feels like work?
-The player retention is horrible. Finding players to play with is difficult. Mostly because of how inherently non-casual it is in how much WORK-like dedication it takes to properly play it. It practically has a reverse fun factor: the longer you play it, the worse you will feel. In comparison, the match rewards feel like nothing and the game feels like waste of time.
-It is a bit grindy. Nothing progresses if you do not play, preferrably for the win as defeats yield considerably less goodies regardless of the level of effort on the part of the player.
-It randomly crashes. It is outright unplayable in the defaul DX11 mode and still occasionally hangs in the much more stable DX9 mode, that you can only enter by running the game from Steam app library page.
-It has voice chat. The XBOX Live cancer is possible from those SERIOUS BIZNEZ -crowds. You have been warned. The lack of player retention makes this pleasantly rare, though.
-It is made with Unity. This is a very, very, very bad thing. I had to set my ATI settings to power-saving mode to stop it from overheating my GPU. Every Unity game has this effect and pretty much means it is a diarrhea turd. That is the sugar-coated way to describe it.
-The overuse of signaling gets easily on the nerves. Those repeated audio bites with some voices are godawful.
-The lack of variety in mission objectives. Kill, destroy or protect by killing and destroying, with occasional pressing of G to rope a floating supply balloon for bonus points. It gets old after the first time you do it. You'll end up doing it constantly if you keep playing this game. PvP and PvE are similar in this sense, except that PvP enemies have the variety of a human mind. Holy jumping boredom, Batman!

In summary, if you like airships and overly complicated, feels-like-work Team CO-OP games, this one's for you. 80% score . If you want to have a consistently casual, fun experience, your dissatisfaction is likely. 20% score. Because of the crazies who are likely to enjoy a game like this one, I have to technically recommend the game. Maybe it is better with friends. I got the free promotion entry and frankly it mostly feels like pain and I would have regretted paying any money for it. At least now I have something to boot up in case I feel like becoming a masochist.",1527771019,1527771019,True,0,0,0.0,0,False,False,False,False,,,,608800

We are planning add into the store only cosmetic items that do not affect the gameplay. 
Currently the store has: 
- Mounts (you can also tame them in the game without buying anything); 
- Titles (the word to be written in front of your name, for example, ""Baron Kevan"", ""Duke Kevan"", etc.). Does not affect the gameplay; 
- Booster that increases speed of resource gathering and construction time (reduces only time spent on the action. For example, if you collect apples for 2 seconds, then having a booster, you will collect them for 1 second);

It looks really pretty and I really love the basic idea and concept (space colonization, yay!). However, the AI just does not work. 

In this game, you have to set up and manage a variety of supplie chains. so far so good. But your employees/colonists are just not up for the task and stand around or walk in circles, move boxes from here to there and back and forth and do anything exept following their priorities. That sucks and is a pain in the rear to watch. 

But still, I like the scope of the game, the settings and its presentation. Maybe in a few months, the AI will have grown up and the game will be fun. But as of now: nope.


EDIT (31.7h on record):

I gave this game another good chance. As I said, there's much to love about concept and presentation. But there are too many ways the AI does not work (does the term “artificial intelligence” rally apply here?). And that kills alot of fun.

Once I was lucky and I managed to grow my colony past 100 inhabitants, that's when my colonists started to take extended outdoor hikes to nowhere for no particular reason, only to suffocate one after another. After I lost too many engineers this way, my colony ran out of spares. And that's when the infrastructure started to crumble. I ran out of energy, then oxygen, and my station was rendered into an outrageously expensive space graveyard.

The colonist’s jobs are rather simple, actually. There's only a few basic specializations: worker, biologist, engineer, medic and security. But people are just not doing their jobs and the prioritization button has no function. You desperately need spares? Here's iron and a machine. But where's the engineer? He stands happily, walks, stands again, walks back, takes a nap, passes by the spares machine, looks, walks away, and so forth. Same with all the other roles, these things happen All. The. Frinking. Time.  And this is really very sad to watch. And I have seen enough.",1445115945,1445689425,False,5,0,0.5027322173118591,0,True,False,False,False,,1448933495.0,"Hello there!

Too much effort on the store, not enough on gameplay.

The driving is good, but this game is very shallow. The gameplay is go from A to B and sometimes C. You are given many choices throughout the game but they all feel shallow. You are given a brief and incomplete version of some events and expected to make a binary choice. I kept hoping that there was anything more, some reason to explore the world, but there isn't really anything else. I think that its a shame since the driving is good and the world is huge and looks great.

I think that there were some concepts that were teased early on that I feel could have made this game a lot better. First is racing, we are teased about races going on a lot but we don't see any nor can we participate. Next is interaction with law enforcement. I hit many law enforcement HOVAs, but never received a fine or was chased which made the ""CorpSec"" seem silly despite the story suggesting otherwise. Another thing is that there are only a few purchasable customizations and it was easy to have enough money for all of them half way through if you spend any time picking up the random items. They could have used them as another way to explore if they had money as a larger incentive.

If there was a ""meh"" option, I would choose that. However, I feel that it is fitting that this is a binary choice for which the concequences are unclear and I feel I put more effort into making it than it deserves.",1622698312,1622698312,False,1,0,0.5183980464935302,0,True,False,False,False,,1622922917.0,"Thanks for your review.

Not pay to win. The Dragon Crystals are used to speed up crafting, buy classes without farming (so far only DragonSlayer but I suspect this will be the case for Paladin, Necromancer, etc) and cosmetics. No stat advantage is really given through the micro-transactions.

Regularly updated. I have been keeping up with this game since the kickstarter first started, the developers release a lot of updates that keep people looking forward to the next release.

From my experience other players are willing to help someone with their quest or boss fight which is helpful as certain fights can't be solo'd without potion spam.

Cons:
The graphics are horrible for a game that started it's development in the year it did. The textures aren't smooth, they get blurry and look like they're carelessly painted on without much attention given. I understand this game was intended to be cross-platform for PC and Mobile/Tablets but this holds it back.

The combat system simply isn't fun. It's the same combat system from their 2D game Adventure Quest Worlds just ported over to AQ3D. You press 4 buttons in battles that are not engaging enough. The weapon types don't really matter, the player uses a cross bow as a melee weapon, the team should have figured out how to make different weapon types have different actions and animations before releasing them. The boss Akriloth has a decent take on actual mechanics but it's no where near good enough. There are times when the player clearly dodges an attack from Akriloth but the hit still registers and the player takes damage.

Many mobs in this game are reskins or just plain copy and pasting but with a different time attached to the monster and this includes boss monsters. 

AQ3D has limited character customisation, truthfully it has improved since the Alpha when they added hair colour options, beards and so on. The thing customisation is lacking is different body types. I'm not asking for a detailed body creation but preset templates would be an improvement to give the player a sense of individuality. Right now players are just clones of eachother but with different hairstyles and skin colours. 

Reliance on the player base's nostalgia is also another factor. Most people that play this game were fans of Artix Entertainment's previous games and they are aware of this. This game once again takes place on Lore with characters that have already appeared in the other games. I would have liked it if it took place on the same world but a different continent with fresh new characters and cameos from old characters sprinkled in.

Conclusion:
Can I recommend the game in it's current state? No. If you are someone which has never played an Artix Entertainment game before you probably won't like this game.
If this game was made by an unknown developer it wouldn't have the playerbase it has today.
The team behind this game needs to focus on developing the mechanics of this game further and polishing it instead of the stories and Dragon Crystal cosmetic collections they're releasing right now as if it's a properly released game. 

",1521564930,1521564930,False,22,1,0.683658480644226,0,False,False,True,False,,1521746253.0,"Hi there! Thank you so much for your feedback! The devs are constantly working on fixing and improving issues and releasing updates/patches almost weekly. This has been a constant balance as an indie game company with a small staff. We also have a Game Plan posted here that is updated every Monday - https://aq3d.com/game-plan/. 

Regarding some of your specific points:

For the art style, Artix Entertainment has always had a unique art style and we find that that sets up apart from other companies. If we tried to compete with FFIV graphics or Guild Wars, it'd take forever for our handful of artists to get anything made and people would just play those games instead. We made a decision to help us stand out, and give us a reasonable pipeline.

Combat is definitely still rough. Akriloth is like a rough example of what we want the game to feel like. The fun part of Akriloth is how the mechanics are a hack. The debs haven't had a chance to tackle beefier combat mechanics but we looked at what we had and improvised. One the plus side, it feels a lot better than the usual ""stand next to enemy, spam number keys"". On the con side, like you said, it's noticeable when you leave the area and still take the hit. Think of it as a proof of concept of what we're aiming for, and eventually we hope to have legit tools to make it happen and not have to jump through the hoops we did.

Most MMOs reskin mobs. It's hard to avoid this one without just buying assets or spending tons of time on more unique enemies. Right now, we try to trickle them in the existing pipeline but our animator ends up spending tons of time on cinematics more than mob animations.

For character customization, we definitely want more features but nothing has been completed yet that is ready to go live.

We're definitely relying on the playerbase right now considering we haven't spent any ad dollars. Despite saying this is beta, this is still closer to early alpha as far as features. Once we feel the game has enough features to start spending ad money on (so far, no ad money spent), we'll see how we stack against the non-nostalgia crowd. The game is still early enough in development that in any AAA studio, no one would even have seen gameplay footage, yet. But we're all about the early access here which means you get to see all the broken stuff that spawns the polished stuff. (even the difference between initial combat visualization and now is incredibly different).

We definitely appreciate you pointing out that we're not pay to win and we are honored you have been keeping up to date with the game for so long! At the end of the day, we're definitely aiming higher than what you see, but it takes time and we are a tiny team!",429790

And trust me, this means alot, because most of the time i overvalue games and i respect the developers alot. I also recommend most of the games i play, to my friends. I would honestly not recommend crossout to anyone. This became one of the worst games i have ever played. Just because of some poor decisions

Let me talk about some key elements of the game.

GRINDING
Don't be fooled by the fact that the game is free. The small playerbase is used to invest lots of money in the game, so as a new player, or a player who really plays for free, it's a dead end. You will be smashed by the others, since the items are tier based and every tier is more expensive than the prior one. The last one takes few months, even years of grinding, depending on how often you play, of course, if you don't pay real money. That being said, you might just find yourself in huge disadvantages if you play for free. There were decent ways to farm in game coins fast, but don't worry, the developers made sure to patch them, so everything is a slow process and you don't get anything significant without paying them.
Also, don't have a mindset where you consider buying a single pack worth, for a single overpowered item. This never stops, they always release packs, and after that they pummel the old stuff into the ground, so new stuff can be on top and that will encourage you to buy it. 

I will rate this with 4/10.

GAMEPLAY
The game had a period when it was decent. That was the time when i enjoyed the game alot.  But they made sure to screw that, just for money. Now the game revolves around cringe playstyles, like pushing, incapacitating, exploiting, slowing, ramming (basically, you can't fight back in many cases) and most importantly, the no need of aiming. The developers love auto-aim, so even on PC, you see it everywhere. There is no such thing as FAIR PLAY in this game. I'd say that exploiting stuff is about 60%, randomness is 30% and skill is 10%. The percentage of skill went in a constant decrease over the time. There are very low chances to see strategic gameplay, like map control, taking vantage points, everything is either full camp, where you wait your enemy and incapacitate them, or brainless push your enemies and also, you incapacitate them by pushing them and pinning them onto a wall. Every update goes into that direction, even more deep. Everything with potential and needed skill is diminished or removed, i guess that comes from the fact that the amount of people which would embarrass themselves and play something that's not fair, are also not that bright, and they have worse financial education, that means more money into the devs' pockets if those people are satisfied.

I will rate with 5/10.

GAME BALANCE
This is awful. I won't explain much here, it's basically determined by what brings most income to the devs. What encourages the players to pay, is extremely strong. After it becomes old and there is new stuff bringing fresh money, that item is balanced or it goes into oblivion and no one uses it anymore. There is a big gap between the items of this game (time to kill differs alot, some things are too resistant, while other fall down in one sneeze). You will convince yourself of this, when you realize how many weapons, movement parts, cabins and hardware parts this game has, and how many are actually used by the majority. You might enjoy this game until you start getting one shotted or when you find yourself in situations where you lose without the chance of fighting back.

2/10.

CREATIVITY
It got diminshed by the time, which is very sad, because it is the main attraction of this game. Now mostly everyone uses ugly crafts, and most likely, easy to use and copied from exhibition.

A solid 8/10 tho.

GAME MECHANICS
Bugs are very numerous, they take months to be solved (while money based packs are released more often xD), or.. they never get solved. Because the engine is like 20 years old. So in my opinion, it has no further potential. The game reached its pinnacle some time ago, now it's only falling down. Mobility is awful, and there are various ways to even decrease the mobility. Is the game related to reality? Hell no.

4/10.

MANAGEMENT
As i said, bugs are not solved too often, not even the game breaking ones. After all, it doesn't give them more money. They don't care too much about the english speaking community. They don't care at all about your progress in the game. They don't care if you get hacked. You can farm for something you desire for months or years, they can always render it useless. The only consolation you will get is that you can sell it or scrap it, which gives you way less of the value it had in the moment you decided to acquire it. They sometimes decide to add A FEW additional details on the current maps. They take the maps away (why tho?), and after few months or years, they release them back with like 4-5 more barrels, 2-3 more rocks and one source of smoke. The game has a small playerbase and too many modes, so queue times are long. The game servers are pretty unstable, you sometimes might find yourself disconnected, with no possiblity to go back to the current match. As a good and funny joke, the game decides to ban you for unsportsmanlike behavior, because you left the battle. Another detail i must mention, if you are not from europe or north america, don't even bother trying the game, the lag makes it close to unplayable. Perpetual beta, good cover for their shady actions.

2/10.

FAIR PLAY
One good aspect of the game is the reduced number of cheaters, you will be really lucky to see one, honestly. But you won't miss them, since the players can exploit so many things in this game, and it's even more frustrating than encountering cheaters. Cheaters can be banned, but you won't be banned for exploiting and ruining someone's experience. Auto aim is all around the place, and sometimes it is more rewarding than aiming manually and playing fair. Sometimes, you will find yourself dead in the beginning of the round, because of a sneaky guy. That's also a very common thing.

5/10

COMMUNITY
Overall, the community is pretty toxic. Some of this toxicity is provided by the frustration, frustration that comes from the gameplay. Some players wanna win with any price, they have no honour, so ruining your experience is not an obstacle for them. They embarrass themselves in the most deplobrable ways just to win, and the developers strongly encourage that. The player of this game are also very hypocrites, good amount of them play only for that small ego boost you get from pvp and pretend it's for fun.

6/10

AI IN THE GAME
Crossout relies on bots alot, because the community is small and activity is low. Man, sorry to say but, if you would hire a janitor, he would do a better job on the AI honestly. The bots have the following behavior, rush blindly at the beginning of the round, they take agro on some player and they're so determined on that, they could chase that specific player through an acid lake, a group of enemies without even considering switching targe. This is very disappointing because the game has alot of PVE.

1/10.

This comes from someone who played the game for over 5k hours total (not only steam), and played alongside the best players in the game, for a long time, so winning was not an issue. Just imagine how bad this game is designed, that you hate it even when you win alot.

Did i mention there are INVISIBLE WALLS ON LITERALLY EVERY ROCK OF EACH AND EVERY MAP?

UPDATE 2nd of december. They just released a battlepass. That battlepass had an item with an unfinished model. But it still got released. Not only that, but half of the content was from a previous battlepass. The greed level is unprecedented

My advice for potential new players? Stay the hell away from this game. Consider it a scam and just avoid it",1623922621,1642094877,False,120,10,0.7765361666679382,0,False,False,False,False,,,,386180

Announced back in 2018, [b]Contraband Police[/b] has been one of the most anticipated titles amongst the [i]PlayWay S.A.[/i] catalogue. Considering their large and wide deck of high quality games, that is saying a lot.
After a couple of delays, and fans questioned if the game was ever coming out, [i]Crazy Rocks[/i] absolutely shutters any doubt, releasing it with an absolutely outstanding quality

The game is good, so good, it's a straight up Double-A title, elevating any expectation you could ever have. If you think this is just another simulation game, you have no idea where you're getting in! [b]Contraband Police[/b] will surprise you, as it surprised me throughout its campaign.

Welcome to Acaristan, a fictional Communist country in an equally fictional world surrounded by different cultures and values. You're the fresh appointed rookie to the border post. Your job? Control everyone that comes in, as you have to look out for criminals, contraband and even deal with humanitarian dilemmas.

All of this looks great on paper, but perhaps a bit simple. That's why [i]Crazy Rocks[/i] went all in, delivering an elaborate and engaging game, fusing management and action in an exciting campaign, surrounding players with a plot, choices and events that further extends the overall experience.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

After the conclusion of the well elaborated tutorial, which does a great job teaching the basic mechanics, a considerable amount of new features will unlock progressively. It's a great way to avoid players being overwhelmed, since there are quite a few of them. Checking ID Cards, Passport Numbers, or possible hidden contraband is just the beginning.

As days progress, new factors will unlock, such as the need to check the licence plate, vehicle type and its weight, and many more. The principles go much deeper, as players start to notice changes amongst the regime rules. Political conflicts may end up in harsh decisions, such as denying entry based on country of origin, or even profession. 

You, as the border officer, can inevitably accept or refuse whoever you see fit, but each time the intended decision is taken, money is earned. Having a negative flow will result in the post bankrupt. However, decisions truly become dilemmas when morality is questioned. Some of the people you either accept or refuse will eventually reach out to you, detailing the impact of your decision. I found this to be a nice little touch.

With your daily obligations completed, you are free to roam the town as you wish. Take prisoners to the Labor Camp for an extra profit, trade or buy new items and weapons, search collectables or treasures, and engage in shoot-outs. I found the time after the working hours to be really satisfying, but also very short.

[b]Contraband Police[/b] is far more than a 3D [b]Papers, Please[/b], in fact, it's a straight-up Police Sim game with no compromises in its arrangement. Random events will trigger which require you to defend an area, support officers of the law or just chase down criminals on the runaway. Other events, however, are story related and progress hand in hand with your rank. These missions are unique and present a special overview regarding the country's regime. Spy on the opposition, tail suspects, or help to solve a murder by collecting evidence and hearing the witness.

As you earn money, experience and new ranks, it's almost obligatory to improve your outpost. Upgrade or hire new guards, expand the jail, storage and your own house. Buy new police vehicles and upgrade them to become an unstoppable force. These updates will save you time and help you further manage the confiscated goods.

Let me tell you, for such a small town, there are terrorists trying to overtake the regime, criminals who want to put their hands on the confiscated goods, or just a bunch of misfits who want to free the prisoners. The roads are not safe, and while driving around you have a new third person camera, in case driving in first person isn't your cup of tea. The overall driving feels substantially solid and satisfying, with welcoming realistic touches included.

You wouldn't be a police officer ready to change the regime without some shooting involved, right? In [b]Contraband Police[/b], the intense shoot-outs feel good, not over the top as you'd expect in a [i]Call of Duty[/i], but instead allowing you to decide the best approach.  Either escape or face the threat. The last option will reward you, especially because you can loot the enemies. Even though they tend to disappear rather quickly after you kill them.

With 30 different days, [b]Contraband Police[/b] is quite lengthy, offering quite the replayability. During scripted moments, the game will save at every major spot. Otherwise, it will save in the beginning of the day, and at the end of your duty. I'd still prefer a quick-save function, but I understand the idea of having players dealing with their choices. You can even consider this to be perhaps the first Police Survival game, if you will. 

Difficulty wise, it's a slow start, where escaping with life may very well be your biggest reward. But as money starts to flow, and with better gear, those criminals have their days numbered. The progression is highly gratifying, and playing it without restarting the day will most likely result in peculiar moments. Not to mention you can in fact lead your border post to bankruptcy, so the whole dynamic value of choices is important.

[h1]Final Notes[/h1]

Visually, Contraband Police looks good, has some nice design touches and textures. I particularly enjoyed the lightning, perhaps out of everything else. However, a lot of work went to create a handful of different vehicle sets, plus a distinguishable deck of NPC's. These two aspects are, after all, obligatory considering the game we're dealing with. If you like how the aesthetics look here on the Steam Store, you'll overall enjoy its visuals through and out.

I have been playing since February 27th, which by then Contraband Police was already very stable. I believe it was already in its stable version, and although updates having been released, the overall performance was always quite decent.

Settings offer some optional changes, but I found the optimization to be quite good for a game developed in Unity. Only lost a few frames when driving in the third person mode. I did, however, had Anti-Aliasing maxed out. Shadows and other details can also be lowered, but with an RX 6700 XT, the game ran flawless at maximum settings. The frame drops were most likely due to my CPU.

Aside from all the possible configurations, I found Field of View to be the most limited one, maxes out at just 70. The language package is very diverse and will most likely satisfy players worldwide.  Considering the active development cycle, you can expect new features being implanted in the future, either by further re-arranging the performance, or by adding new gameplay content.

Which side will you choose? Free the country, or play by the rules of the regime? It's your call. Different outcomes surprised me, as I was expecting a much more linear setting. Still, with an amazing setting, captivating gameplay and a strong sense of freedom, [b]Contraband Police[/b] is incredible for its price tag, especially with a discount on launch day.",1678284226,1678284339,True,42,2,0.6997604370117188,0,False,False,False,True,,1678284886.0,"Thank you very much for such an extensive review, we're glad you enjoyed the experience :)",756800

The save game system also needs work. You can only 'save and quit' for some reason. There is no way to save your game once you get yourself in a position where you feel somewhat comfortable. The game saves your progress automatically.

There’re only 3 levels, and there's alot of jank. For example, I've died twice so far just from jumping. No nearby explosions, full health, not falling out of the map or off of a ledge, immediate death on landing from a normal jump. If you don't mind this kind of thing, read on. Otherwise, wait for polish.

Vortex of Pain is a side-scrolling beat-em-up with alot of unpolished physics interactions. Sometimes the interactions are hilarious, as when everything or your enemies are blowing up and flying everywhere. Other times, as mentioned above, you're dying for either no apparent reason or for reasons that seem outside your control. There are mundane annoying moments, like when a random enemy headbutts you out of nowhere and you're forced to wait for your character to just get back up already before being knocked down again, and there are awesome moments like when you find yourself bouncing enemies in the air and against walls repeatedly.

The worst moments haven't been bad enough to offset the fun ones. The environments are visually distinct, if odd due to lower-end assets, and the enemy types feel different from each other. There are standard large and small enemies, backflipping ninja enemies, enemies that try to act like cars, mimes that grapple you... there's at least 1 other indie beat-em-up I can think of (but won't mention) that looks better but somehow lacks even this much enemy variety.

Player abilities feel fairly standard, and have been improved from when I first tried the game. You can now automatically grab enemies when you walk into them, which makes grappling far easier and useful over needing to rely on a grapple button. The grappling button is still present, but I've always found it hard to use.

Overall, still fun if a little frustrating for the weird deaths. Even if you don't buy today, I'd recommend keeping an eye on Vortex of Pain.",1605507648,1609135786,True,3,0,0.5621959567070007,0,True,False,True,False,,1607099881.0,"Thank you for your feedback! We just released an update which addresses some of your critiques.

""It's a bit like rolling a die to determine if you'll randomly explode while playing Streets of Rage.""

We'd like to hear from players if there are some places that are too chaotic for their own good. We are trying to find a balance between having funny unexpected situations, but also giving the player a chance to react to them and use them for his/her advantage. In this update, we reduced the bounciness of the ball props to give the player a better chance to react to them, and removed some of them from the mall level's sport shop.

""Another janky aspect of Vortex is how you don't collide with enemies. At all. In several other beatemup titles, walking into enemies automatically triggers a grab state without using a button. In Vortex, you and the enemy can simply pass through each other. This can make it harder to determine when you can actually grab the enemies, and I generally found it to be far more effective to not even try.""

We added a traditional grappling mode where the player starts grappling when walking into enemies. We forgot to mention in the tutorial section that it's easier to succeed in grappling if the enemy is staggered first by punching him. We added that hint to the tutorial, and worked on the gameplay guidance in general. We added small video screens which demonstrate the most complex moves to the first level, and loading screen and game over tips about undocumented features, moves and strategies.

""Your general abilites are fairly standard. You can run, jump, execute an attack string, and utilize a heavy attack, in addition to the previously mentioned grab. All feel fine in execution, although I often found myself wishing it was a bit easier to juggle enemies and thereby kill them faster. Everyone (you and your foes) spend so much time lying on the ground that it can get tedious waiting for everyone to get back up.""

We reduced the time enemies and players spend lying on ground and slightly sped up the rising animations. We also slightly reduced health from some of the weakest enemies. On the hard difficulty levels, enemies' health is balanced in a way that it is supposed to encourage the player to use and mix diverse moves, like strong attacks, air attacks, grapples and air grapples instead of relying on the basic combo strikes to beat them faster.

""At the moment, Vortex of Pain has only 3 levels. However, the levels are not overly short, and there're significant opportunities to test your skills in each one. If I have any complaints regarding their structure (unrelated to how bland looking they are), 
it's that each level feels fairly similar to me. Each starts kinda easy, then gets hard up to about the same level of difficulty. If more levels are added down the road, I hope the developers go back and adjust the difficulty accordingly.""

We are working on new levels, and we plan to adjust the overall difficulty of the game throughout the project. The difficulty was slightly adjusted in the new update
(mostly by adding a few more enemies and making some enemy types stronger) to make overall level of difficulty higher as the game progresses. We'd love to hear more difficulty feedback from players on the discussion board.

If these types of game play interest you, then maybe wait for a sale and have at it.  The problem is that absolutely everything you do is self-driven.  There is no 'winning', no end-game content...just more of the same, ad infinitum.  Eventually there's a point where the game transitions from cool and interesting, to repetitive and pointless. You'll have billions of credits, own every ship, be elite in every category and have nothing left but more of the same.

Additionally, the Odyssey ""expansion"" (note the use of quotes - this is NOT an expansion in my opinion) has, if anything, increased the required pointless grinding, decreased the graphical diversity, and has provided absolutely no new story content.  The changes to the game menus and UI actually make no sense and are challenging enough to experienced players and will, in many cases, confuse new players aplenty. Save yourself time and money and look elsewhere for your space opera fix.

Every job has difficulties and moral dilemmas every now and then. Professional journalists for example, may have to write about thing they aren’t quite interested in, or even worse, criticize something they might have warm feelings about. For fan type reviewers such difficulties are quite uncommon, however sometimes exclusions of the rules happen. 

I was supposed to finish this review by the release date, but decided to hold horses and give developers a bit more time to fix bugs, as game was quite broken on release. Maybe if actual game had <Early Access> plank, the review would’ve been positive as a measure of “prepayment” for a quite promising concept and active development, because it’s one of those nice cases when developers seem to listen to the community and fix what’s not working. 

With that being said, it breaks my heart even more, to give “The Last Train” a negative review, however as of today (that is 10.09.2018) I’m afraid I still cannot recommend the game. Maybe few months later things will be completely different, and people are going to smile, while reading this review. I honestly hope things WILL change, but again, as of today, I’m afraid I still cannot recommend the game. 
However let’s begin our analysis and see why it took me so much text to write such a strange preview:

[h1]So what is this game about?[/h1]
“The last train” is a mixture of adventure, RPG and survival game where you take a role of a train driver in 1945 in alternative universe, where World War 2 ended by Japan making a devastating attack on USA. As name claims, you’ll work as driver of train engine in USA. You are supposed to pick up passengers and deliver them to the point of destination. Upon arrival, those passengers give you food and materials for upgrading the train.

[h1]The story and game world[/h1]
The game offers two gamemodes: Story and Survival. The only real difference between them is that story mode has… Actual storyline. In survival mode you are supposed to deliver passengers till you’re out of resources. Then you’ll get a high score and will be able to compare it with other players.

So let’s return to the story mode: The game starts in quite shiny colors and the narrator gives us brief information on what happened and why there’s an apocalypse now. Basically, that’s the whole story for the upcoming 1-2 in-game months. From now on you’ll have to survive in game world. So yes, the concept is interesting, however the first problems rise here already:[list]

[*]It is unclear how to move the story forward. You just drive from one state to another and deliver passengers. Then suddenly some more pieces of story pop up. Aaaaand done. You’ll have to deliver more passengers. Did this story part activate because I delivered enough passengers? Did it activate because I left many passengers behind? What do I need to do to activate next part of the story? Nobody knows.

[*]The story itself seem to revolve around you and your train. While that doesn’t quite seem like a problem on paper, there actually is a problem behind the lines, as game doesn’t elaborate much on ingame universe: What happened to the other states which you can’t visit? Were they nuked? What’s going on in Europe and Asia? Does the war still go on there? So many questions, so few answers…

[*]That’s mostly nitpicking, but: What kind of technology level is in this universe, if people are starving and suffering, but every second passenger can offer you enough fuel to travel to another state?[/list]

 [h1]Visual Aspect[/h1]
In most cases visuals look interesting. Dark colors really manage to depict depressive universe. Each station has unique look, showing each state’s most famous places. There are also almost all 50 states available for a visit, so if you are uncommon with USA geography, this game might even give you a short lesson on the location of the most states of the country. During journeys you’ll see many nice looking places, be it some city ruins, or oceans with sank ships. Unfortunately game has some unpleasant surprises in store as well: [list]

[*]While overall gamma is introduced via dark colors, there’s a toxic green train for player’s choice which looks quite out of place. Usually dark colors fit with bright red, when one wants to show, for example, blood. But toxic green? That’s something personally I see for the first time.

[*]Lack of animations. This is something I’m really surprised to see. You’ll quickly notice that not a single train part is animated. For a game where train takes an important part of gameplay it’s a really huge letdown.[/list]

 [h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Saying in advance: no, you cannot control your train via keyboard. The only time when you have direct control over the train is during actual preview. In normal gameplay you’ll have to maintain balance between picking up a passenger you want to help and a passenger who offers better reward. Upon having enough materials you can cook, craft items or upgrade your train, enlarging the inventory size, increasing the amount of passengers you can carry, etc... If you are low on resources, you can visit the city and break into houses (make sure to keep crafted special tools on hand, though). Each house can be broken into only once. Obviously, we’ll cover weak spots here too:[list]

[*]Cooking system is totally broken and unneeded at this point. What’s the point of cooking a salad which gives +5 nutrition points, if you can just eat items separately and have up to +15 nutrition points? That’s not even mentioning the fact some food types have negative nutrition points. Another problem with food is that you can never see the final dish you’ll cook. Because of cooking blind, you also risk to prepare spoiled food with -10 nutrition points. So tell me, how could one break that system so badly?

[*]Unbalanced rewards system. At this point there’s simply no need to travel on far distances as rewards quite often are the same.

[*]A lot of bugs which bring devastating effect to fun:
-When you upgrade the amount of passengers your train can carry, you are supposed to see more train carriages. That doesn’t happen because coordinates for said carriages are misplaced and only on top tier upgrade you can see about ¼ of the first carriage.
-When delivering multiple passengers to the station, each of them is supposed to bring a pop up window and thank your driver, but instead of closing one window, sometimes you somehow manage to close all the windows at same time, which is quite annoying and doesn’t always let you even read the final of their story.
-Passengers walking on the station are easy to be misclicked. Especially when there are multiple of them and they walk closely. Things get even worse once you upgrade your train, as by this upgrade, your train moves further forward and stops by the center of the screen, so you have to blindly move mouse and try to hit needed passenger.[/list]

[b]There are more things I could tell, but let’s just stop it here and sum it all up:[/b]
On the one hand we have a nice looking and somewhat promising game concept. It indeed has some strong points and some day it may shine, even, who knows.

On the other hand we indeed have a CONCEPT of the game in its worst meaning: Lack of train animations, tons of bugs, unbalanced reward system, broken cooking…  All of that indicates on either lack of experience or lack of time from developers. Clearly, game should’ve had Early Access in the end of the days. Maybe it would give developers enough time to fix what’s broken and even add some more interesting features, like more random events. That would certainly spice things up.

Thanks a lot for taking your time to play the game we really appreciate it. Our team is hard at work fixing most of the issues you've mentioned. As far the story beats go, it is based on which passenger you pick up and which ones you leave behind.

It will allow you to explore the radiation zones in the game.

This is the first game we've made where we've had to rely on so many different game systems to work together to create a cohesive expereince. We really hope you would give the game a second chance when we launch update 1.1.

TLDR: bit grindy, nice people, low key p2w but you can still get almost everything for free with enough time.

now the real review:
ngl this game is VERY addictive. I started playing and then I suddenly realized that it had been about 5 or 6 hours and I had to take a break to eat, I immediately logged back in. The community is mostly nice and if you ask for help in chat you are almost guaranteed to get a response... it might be someone laughing at you for being under level 10 but most of the maxed players are really nice. I found a sick guild after only a few hours and even though they were all level 30+ they took me in (level 7, 9 hours total). I now over 50 hours on the game and am level 23. This is an amazing game but a massive time sink and it is grindy, you will spend hours fighting the same monsters over and over for one drop. (4 hours of meatcutter with no drop yet.) it also is slightly microtransaction heavy and does feature a subscription program of sorts but totally could be play as a f2p (like me). If you have a few friends who are willing to sink countless hours on a game for a cosmetic? this is the game for you. I convinced some of my league/warframe playing friends to get this game with me and they LOVE it.

I highly recommend this game if you're on a tight budget, looking for something fun to play with friends, or simply enjoy UFC games minus all the crazy grappling. 

Drunken Wrestlers 2 simply put is fun. The [b]gameplay[/b] at first may seem a little funny, but once you get used to how the engine works, then fun seriously starts to begin. The control scheme is very simple, yet very fun to use. WASD provide basic movement, shift allows the player to run, up/down arrow keys are kicks, and left/right arrow keys are punches. Pressing a different direction will allow the player to try out different moves (hook vs jab, kick vs round-house kick, etc...). The hitting from a distance isn't an issue; when you get up close to an opponent it gets a little interesting. You're able to hit at a close distance, but all the shots taken don't land. Some may land given what button is pressed. The game seems to encourage players to keep their distance in order to deal maximum carnage. Blocking is a system of it's own and really appreciate when you're playing against button mashers. The player may block as much as they want, given that their blocking meter is full. This discourages players to constantly block, yet comes in handy if timed properly. 

The [b]visuals and graphics[/b] are probably the biggest argument against the game. However, I think the graphics are perfectly fine once you get used to the controls. I think the graphics perfectly suit the game and absolutely work with the devs intended impact when landing a blow. Land that big uppercut, the opponent might go flying. Land a solid round-house kick, and you might just kick the opponents head clean right off. No panic though - they're still alive, but they're slowly losing life due to blood loss. The [b]music and sounds[/b] are quite minimal, but again, the gameplay makes up for the lack in the graphics and sounds domain. 

Overall, a highly recommended game from me. Considering it's free and it's a great UFC substitute (minus the grappling), I'm giving it two solid thumbs up bud! It's free - what are you waiting for - try it out!!!

Gameplay is interesting if you like games like Papers Please, but this game has more.

Game has choices and lose conditions. If you run your outpost to the ground you lose.

Summary: 
I have enjoyed playing this game, though I'll admit my first attempt at a playthrough was maddening.  The harder difficulty level is unreasonably hard.  The easier difficulty level slants as too easy.  There's no middle ground.   The story, however, is interesting and after a while fairly engrossing.

Points of interest:
* The game is not without it's bugs, though nothing severe. Most are minor things like bad text or speech.
* The combat on the harder difficulty borders on minor battles being boss fights.  The easier difficulty makes you feel like superman.
* The story is definitely designed to be quasi-linear.  It's not very open ended.  Your first playthrough you can and will miss many things which you can no longer go back to.
* There's a lot of interface things you won't immediately understand, like how to use health kits.  You have to go to the party management screen for that.  Further, if you have a party member who excels at say computers, it frequently won't use them if it's not setup right in the party management screen. Once you figure that out, you're golden.
* I love the world that was created and the story I've gotten through so far.  HUGE amount of content, plays a lot like FO2 or older isometric RPGs.  Story delivers and definitely puts you in the place of trying to pick what you think is right, which is actually more difficult than it sounds.  There are no cartoonishly evil villains.  Everyone has good and bad in them in each group and it's up to you to decide, which can be complicated and difficult.  Alliances are made and broken at the whim of the player or certain story members.  It's got a solid amount of political intrigue and power-brokering later in the game.
* The tech variations are pretty severe, which I can appreciate.  I like the explanations for the way the world is the way it is from bioprocessors to the advent of gunpowder.

Overall:
I'd give it a 7 or 7.5 out of 10.  Not perfect, but definitely fun if you're into scifi isometric RPGs - just don't play it on hardmode unless you like to lose, a lot.",1685814169,1685814169,True,3,0,0.542483627796173,0,True,False,True,True,,,,648410

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the performance and stability of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development from our two-man code team. 

As an early supporter, you even have the first expansion for free, and the second expansion was free for everyone! 

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

I have no idea what the story is about. All I know is that your a girl in a mental ward who lays in bed and plays out an FPS nightmare. If you die, your tossed back out in the loony bin to hear the screams of your neighbors. There's also a pretty cool mini game that lets you play some Super Mario style levels for power ups which you'd think would be an odd fit, but it actually works really well. There are times I've gotten lost in the mini game section and totally forgot this was an FPS! Really there are three things going on. You've got the bulk of the game which is the shooting, the mini game, and then from time to time you've got some little story bits around your room. The whole thing is very intriguing and I can't wait to see where this ends up.

The bad is that this is early access so its not finished. I've also had some pretty annoying crashes that cost me some really cool weapons and do get some slowdown here and there. Probably just a bit of growing pains and while annoying, nothing has been a deal breaker so far.

I would compare this to Dusk quite honestly. I found Dusk to have a pretty amazing atmosphere with the ability to tell the story without much dialog. Everything was told in the level design, creatures, and backdrop and Nightmare Reaper has a lot of the same vibe. The two games have some significant differences, but as far as delivering a story without really saying anything is where I feel the two have common ground...I mean aside from shooting things. 

One big thing is the weapons and there are a ton. You'd think the guy would run out of ideas, but then you get this spell book that charges up a mini nuke blast and think...ok, lets rock. The sheer variety in death dealers is a really nice touch which I don't think I can stress exactly how well the weapons feel. I wasn't exactly fond of losing pretty much all but one weapon at the end of each level, but then just as fast as I'd get attached to something, I'd find a better one. Ammo is pretty creative too. Found this remote grenade thing that uses your characters health points as ammo. Made some pretty bad mistakes with that thing, but it is a room clearer. 

In closing, I would say if your remotely interested in something like an old school shooter and not too averse to pixels, buy this. I've almost got 8 hours into this thing as of writing this and while probably close to the end of the current content, I'm not there yet. Plus still have quite a bit of the mini game to unlock and I feel like I've missed story bits in the asylum and the game isn't even finished. So I would say replay value is there, but even on a single play through its worth it.",1564624025,1564624025,True,2,0,0.5009979605674743,0,True,False,True,False,,1564932929.0,Glad you enjoyed the game!

The execution still needs a lot of work and since the developer has said that they are going to release it as is, I can't really recommend it.

The main game loop, especially in the start, involves going out in your basic ship, learning to navigate in a realistic fashion and mining though ice which results in runaway minerals that you chase while hoping to not damage your ship too much. Unfortunately, the chasing is actually 90% of the game-play at this point, even after you've unlocked a few upgrades.

After 10 hours I did feel comfortable with the controls and ventured deep enough to find a trade habitat. Unfortunately there is some bug or something but if you choose the wrong option when they initially offer you to trade, they don't ask you again. Restarting the mission didn't fix it.

I just gave up at this point. I was already starting to feel dread at the prospect of going out for more mining runs just to get another piecemeal upgrade with my last one being specifically to trade processed ore to this habitat.

In Elite Dangerous, you're a spaceship pilot and the galaxy is a sandbox for exploration, mining, trading, transportation and combat (either as a bounty hunter or a criminal). Once you get out of the newbie star system, the game doesn't really pressure you into doing anything. You can put in as much or as little time & effort as you want. Your wealth & faction status will probably increase depending on which activities you choose.

Of the available activities, you can take them or leave them. You can take or leave the optional missions. No matter how many missions you complete, the game doesn't portray it as a coherent storyline or a hero's journey. The game won't treat you like a hero or tell you that you're a hero. The game won't allow you to be anything more than a random nobody in a galaxy that is indifferent to your existence. So the purpose and challenge is to find something that you enjoy doing in the game, and to keep doing it.

It's not the kind of game that has a lot of mainstream appeal. For people who want to simulate the day to day work of being a spaceship pilot just for the sake of doing it, to savor the physics & the ship controls, to sense the massive size & empty darkness of outer space, the appeal needs no further explanation. Anybody else will probably not find much to hold their attention in Elite Dangerous.",1586506013,1586695641,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,,,359320

However, the minimal ""improvements"" to the game in the ""live release"" version have no significant impact on the quality of the game.

Thank you for your feedback and for streaming the beta version. We always wanted to provide our beta testers the latest version of Port Royale 4. This is why the steps between the beta and release version were fluid.

We will continue to work on Port Royale 4 and we appreciate any feedback that helps us to further improve the game.

With updates 1.1 to 1.3, we have implemented as much as possible of the feedback received from the community, and we feel that the latest update is a big step forward for the game. 

In update 1.1, Port Royale 4 received improvements to department stores, difficulty settings were adjusted and money became a more valuable resource in the game.
With update 1.1.1, we introduced armed dealer convoys. In addition, further adjustments have made pirate life more challenging, entertaining and more profitable - especially at the beginning of the game.  

Update 1.2 brought further design changes, particularly to city governance, trade routes, general trade mechanics and the mini map.

And in update 1.3, there is now the possibility to declare the independence of your nation – which among other things gives you full control over the diplomatic relations of your nation.

Also added was the option of economic shocks, the tavern, improved naval battles and male variants of the merchant and pirate characters. We also received mixed feedback about the loss of fame introduced with update 1.2 due to its harsh effects, so we have replaced it with a satisfaction bonus.

Once again, thank you for playing Port Royale 4 and giving us your feedback. With all the changes we’ve introduced so far (and those that we will deliver in the future), we hope that you will give Port Royale 4 another chance and stick with us as we continue on this journey. Most importantly - have fun!

-Cheers

Pros:
+ Decent puzzles with a good variety. Most on the easy side
+ Interesting scifi setting
+ Decent story
+ Good voiceover work
+ Multiple endings

Cons:
- Unfortunately, this game falls into the all-too-familiar adventure game trap of ""hunt the pixel"". Multiple puzzles require you to notice and click on a tiny clickable area in order to advance, none of which are ever hinted at or called out by the characters. This is made even worse by the samey color palette meaning noticing these one-pixel-wide areas is extremely difficult.
- Brown/gray color palette + lack of any stunning vista-type locations means the scifi setting is wasted a little bit. There's no area in the game that looks particularly impressive or makes you say ""wow""
- Story, while decent, is incredibly predictable. If you've experienced any type of scifi at all you already have figured out the entire backstory of the game within the first five minutes. This leaves the game without any real twist, which is unfortunate as the game builds it up as if one is coming but it never does
- On the short side, even for an adventure game
- Nitpicky (spoilers)- there's one puzzle that requires you to click on a specific part of the screen that does not even contain a textual indicator that its different from any other part of the scene. I'm talking about finding the battery in the junkyard. Despite almost the whole scene being described as ""junk"" without any additional description dialogue, you're supposed to someone intuit this one specific spot will work with your energy locator despite the lack of any textual or audio indicator that it would. This is even more egregious given that all prior junkyard items have specific descriptive text for their locations. I'd go so far as to call this a bug that should be fixed.",1705452966,1705452966,True,1,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,True,,1705455361.0,"Thanks for your thoughtful review!

On the specific junkpile puzzle you mention, though, I think your critique is slightly off.

I must say that I am very impressed with the turnaround made in the past couple of months.  The developers have made a tremendous push to fix the performance problems that were plaguing the game.  To be honest, I didn't think I'd be able to play the game without replacing my hardware -- however, the recent updates and the game is absolutely playable for me now (I'm still on my original hardware).

There have been many additions to the game since I last checked it out.  The introduction cut-scenes were are happy surprise, a lot of Voice work has been done, tons of little UI improvements.  I'm looking forward to playing the full single-player campaign.

In short: I'm very pleased with the game now.  Great Job to the development team!
*** END UPDATED REVIEW ***


*** OLD REVIEW BELOW ***
Do not recommend -- performance problems with unoptimized code make the game unplayable due to severe lag on lower end hardware.  Just one example: opening the ""Veins of Evil"" can take 5+ seconds on my hardware which is better than minimum spec -- note: that is just to open the VoE, selecting something is another 5+ seconds, etc.

I'm a huge fan of DK1 & DK2 and have high hopes for this game.  I will change this review if the game is fixed or options provided to workaround the performance problems.  I refuse to upgrade hardware that plays other games perfectly fine.

Thank you for the feedback, we're really sorry to hear you're having performance issues. In most cases the UI should be running solidly though if you are running on lower end hardware it is possible it's getting held up a little, we're currently in the middle of recoding it for our 0.7.0 release. We expect that the next patch towards the end of february should herald some major improvements in this area.

We hope to hear from you at that time and hope that your issue will be resolved.

After hitting max level (15 at the time of this review) I took a little break, and then started leveling a 2nd character because reasons, but I'm back and wanted to share my thoughts.

Pros:
+ Convenient class switching system (see Con #4 below.)
+ Convenient fast travel feature.
+ Developers listen to community feedback.
+ Enjoyable and decently paced progression experience.
+ Game doesn't just give you everything or hold your hand.
+ Not Pay2Win (It's Pay2NotFarmOrWait or Pay2NotWait.)
+ Reasonable cash shop practices and prices.
+ Some content (Pumpkin Lord holiday set) cannot be obtained with cash shop currency.

Cons:
- No character depth.
- No endgame content (but we're nowhere near endgame, still salty though.)
- No real challenge.
- No real replayability (see Pro #1 above.)
- Some content (Guardian class) can only be obtained via cash shop.

8/10 - Please note that Beta is Beta.

I was a huge fan of the DKII and i think, that this perfectly fits together with the old DKs.

PROS:
*It feels like a seperate game, with it's own type of style and humor, with quite a lot of new rooms and creatures and not like a new, modified version of the DK series. The gameplay is also improved quite a bit from the old series.
*I love how the spell researching plays bigger role in the WftO, than it did before. And the Titans have replaced Horny.
*The narrator adds to the nostalgic feel of the game.
*The levels do have quite the replay value, (as there are mostly multiple ways to do the levels) especially if you are a freak for the achievements.
*The survival mode. It's quite hardcore in the beginning, but it's also much fun.
*The keepers (underlords) have their own styles and not only colors.

CONS: 
*the game performance (as many others have also noted). Once it gets crowded, the performance drops drastically.
*The main story was too short.

Recap: if you loved the old DK2, you'll probably like this one. As i said - it's not a newer, prettier 1:1 copy of the old games, but it is more of a game of it's own.

Update 2018.11: the game is updated constantly and it feels optimized much better, than it did when writing this review. The achievements and the growing list of custom maps adds to the replay value of the game.",1482968046,1543250435,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,,,230190

Thanks a lot for posting this review. We truly believe that the feedback we receive from our fantastic community helps us make Space Engineers a better experience for everyone.

We are continuing to update the game, fix bugs, add new features, as well improve existing aspects of the game, which will hopefully make Space Engineers the best game it can before it's released from Early Access.

We invite any additional thoughts, comments, suggestions etc. here: https://support.keenswh.com/spaceengineers and we can also help you address any issue you may be experiencing.

If you like Banished, you will like this.  So I am recommending this.  That assumes you don't mind eventually losing, because you will under current circumstances, and that you are the type of person that does not enjoy the constant battle / zombie scenario.  Mercifully, battles seem to be at a minimum and you don't have to waste your resources on constant weapon production.

Now, there is one issue I will mention that really really annoys me.  I will call it the poor me scenario.  You have these events happening and trading, such as it is, going on, you finally get the items you need to help your people and they do... absolutely nothing.  Example:  They are standing around doing nothing because they are hungry.  Understood.  We trade for food.  There it is.  And they do, you guessed it, nothing.  Oh, except wander around the station - ok then go get food!  Eat!  Don't starve!  Nope, they wander around until they starve.  

Suggestions to fix the poor me scenario - allow a rescue mission or perhaps more colonists to show up that will care for these people.  Or, make them smart enough to go. eat. food. no starve.

The other thing I would also like to see would be more planets.  

I recommend this game.  It is a fun game and relaxing when I don't want to fight zombies.  This has actually become one of my top 5 favorite games I've played on Steam.",1454181964,1475107917,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,,,403190

Primordia is a game about the earth after us, the stuff we leave behind: junk, devastation, and robots. The game readily explores the concept of religion in non-human sapients, which is fresh and unique in sci-fi settings where religions are regulary viewed with disdain and are associated with less advance societies. The humanist religion is based around man the builder, creator of wonders and robots. In this world humans are missing, where they went and how they went are mysteries; but our lovely robots have carried own in our absence. Our inventor protagonist, Horatio Nullbuilt, is trying to reclaim what was stolen from him in the opening scenes of the game. This puts him on path to solve his immediate problems and eventually his quest leads him to the city of Metropol where the secrets are slowing unraveling the city.

The game is not without it's humor from the banter between Crispin and Horatio, references to other famous robots, and Horatio's object commentary.  

If your stuck on a puzzle try using Crispin, on an area you can't reach. The game never tells you about this before you have to figure it out. 
  
If you like post-apocalyptic worlds without mankind, adventure games, and robots: this is probably up you alley.",1511723827,1511723827,True,1,0,0.0,1,True,False,False,False,,,,227000

It's aged pretty well too for a ten year old game, assuming you like SCUMM style point and clicks that is.  This very much had some strong Beneath a Steel Sky vibes tot it.

Even finishing a game of this scope was hard for a team of hobbyists, as we opted for depth of areas (plenty of things to interact with) rather than breadth (more rooms). Certainly compared to something like Monkey Island 2 it is much smaller!

The robots have gender (in a very loose sense) because humans gender all sorts of things (ships, tools) including concepts such as justice or the homeland. Most of the gendered robots in the game were made that way by humans—think of Clarity like the statue of justice outside a courthouse. After humans were gone, surviving robots continued to play out the roles they had been assigned, and some even gave themselves such roles to make sense of the world. 

The game mentions that humans had delegated even religious functions to robots (hence Steeple) and after humanity disappeared the AI responsible for religion used that as a lens for explaining the relationship of humans and machines. 

Hope that helps!",227000

Man, also known as ‘The perfect machine’ were the builders from which sentient robots sprang into ‘life’. You play Horatio, a humanoid robot searching for his power core which was stolen by a ‘big robot with claws that shoots lasers’. You have a companion along the way, Crispin. He’s a cocky little robot, full of witty banter and useful advice (although, that advice can be hard to coax out of the little guy at times).

But I digress, back to the story. All I can say is, ‘Wow’. Ok, so it starts a little slow, but once you start learning about you character and his past the game really opens up. Playing as ‘Horatio Nullbuilt V.5’, your character has four versions of prior history of which the data has become fragmented and corrupted. You’ll meet robots along the way that seem to know you, but you haven’t much recollection of them! On top of the world that you are set exploring, this story mechanic really draws you in and makes you hungry for more. I remember thinking that if this game was a book, I’d read the hell out of it! It’d be one of those books that you can’t put down despite having to work early the next day! And in truth, I couldn’t put this game down. Thanks Wormwood Studios, my daughter finally gets to sleep, and instead of capitalising on this moment of rest that I could be having, I decide to turn on my PC and play a little more Primordia!

The music and sounds effects really help to bring this game to life. The background music can be haunting at times, and other times it can be so subtle to lift the mood of a scene that you hardly notice it has changed. The voices of the many robots that populate the world have a slight tinny, and sometimes electronic sound to them, each different from the last. Being how it’s set in a world of robots, Wormwood Studios could have simply hired the same vocal artist and applied filters to his/her voice, but they haven’t gone this route thankfully. Every robot you meet oozes personality, and the voice acting is top notch, adding real character and a human touch to these robots that were, at least in the past, touched by humanity.

Despite all the things that make Primordia such a wonderful game, there are a couple of things that bugged me whilst playing through it. The first thing is the heads up display, or HUD for short. The HUD is located at the top of the screen, and when you drag your mouse up to the top it will pop down, allowing access to the various menu’s and inventory. Sometimes it can get in the way though, as it’s not located at the upper most pixel, and sometimes when you are on the lookout for that next pick-up, or you want to exit to another area, the HUD can slide down, thus breaking the immersion ever so slightly. It’s not a deal breaker by any means, but it can be a slight annoyance at times.

The second thing that got to me the whole time was the graphics. Don’t get me wrong here, I absolutely adore the art style. This game looks great, my problem is that it could have looked amazing. This game isn’t HD, you can set the resolution higher, but you then have to apply a filter to smooth out the jaggies as the game wasn’t designed to run at high resolutions! This results in the image being a little washed out when you play full screen. This wouldn’t be as noticeable on a smaller monitor, but on my 22” screen it was a slight issue.

Gripes aside, Primordia is a polished and lively world with a great story that compels you to finish the game. Clocking in at around 4-5 hours, it’s a journey so full of history and lore that you can’t help but be fascinated by it, the world they have created is really captivating. The central character and his companion guide you through this gritty world, and even though Crispin can be a little on the sarcastic side, you become attached to all you companions, and enemies.",1385469564,1385469564,True,30,0,0.7620796561241149,0,False,False,False,False,,,,227000

If you're all good on that front, go ahead and complete [url=https://support.ubi.com/en-us/faqs/000025947]these PC troubleshooting steps[/url] and [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335]verify your game files[/url] before trying to launch again. If you're finding that this happens in-game, it could be that you needed to update your drivers ( which the PC troubleshooting link can help with ) or you may be having an issue with not having enough available RAM to maintain the game ( which [url=https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/Faqs/000025721/Disabling-Background-Application/]disabling background applications[/url] can help with that! If you continue to have issues, however, please feel free to [url=support.ubi.com/Cases/New]create a support ticket[/url] for additional support and we'll see you through it! :)",646910

Unfortunately  I encountered some pretty nasty bugs that made me stop trying to run the game.

In episode 2 the game stopped after dying 3 time, in 3 different part of the story and I had to restart the chapter over and over. 

I tried any solution founded around the net, checked the game integrety and all my hardware and software is up to date.

Unfortunately I can 't reccomand the game at this point, I have 11 hours played and I can't pass chapter 2 without a crash.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge, huge improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. Two of these are completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate

If you're looking to increase the game's difficulty there's a few options available.

You can also unlock and enable Hell Mode which again increases the difficulty significantly.

After going through the short tutorial I felt prepared to play the game, you start off needing to choose at least 2 characters, despite being singleplayer making it a handful to juggle an extra person for no extra benefit.

The story then consists of finding and pulling random numbered levers across an icy landscape. As I search for Lever 3 without direction or clue my characters tell me they're tired. Great. I mean, the only thing not covered by the Tutorial and now it looks like its a big fucking issue! Beds are also scarce at this point so I am livid.

I find a bed and get to sleep as the anomolys waltz into a lit up building (which the game assured me they would stay away from) and fucked up the Dude, rest his soul.

We are unsure exactly what your issue is though. Stone deposits are infinite, the ground deposits have up to 5 stations for mining and all the vanilla maps have mutliple of these. There are also the discoverable mineral deposits that are also infinite and can expand your stone resource collection.

Hundreds of hours of grind is met with about ten minutes of pay off. The best aspect of this game is being thrown into a world where you have to find your own way, do your own research to find the best way to advance.

But, then you realise it all amounts to nothing, that you spent hundreds of hours in Open play and you have seen five real players, four of which decided to destroy your ship without warning and set you back dozens of hours, you have spent hundreds of hours grinding towards an expensive ship or module and it really only gives you a 5% increase in one stat.

The development team is completely apathetic towards the player base. Every update is broken and lacks content, as if only one or two people even bothered to work on it. They are more then willing to take your money, but don't expect any satisfying game play in return.

The head line feature, five years into development, is a flight tutorial. For existing players the other feature is porting their store from a website into the game. Of course (as of 19/SEPT/19) not only does the site no longer work, but the in game store lacks most of the items they used to sell, which will be added in the next few days. Maybe they should have released it next week after some QA, bug testing and actually finishing the planned features.

Upcoming updates include Fleet carriers, which sounds interesting at first, being able to own and move around a massive ship, but long term players know that beyond eye candy and the clunky ability to move your fleet of ships around they will be mostly useless, yet require hundreds of hours to grind enough credits to buy one.

If you aren't setup and know what you're doing from the start, gonna have a bad time.  Don't level up right?  Gonna have a bad time.  No way to undo mistakes and just snowballs down.

I really want to like this game.  I find a lot of mechanics cool but more frustrating.  The way the game plays out is a prime example, you feel helpless when the team has the ball.  Advanced tactics seem to allude you, IE moving to players at once.  Shootouts are just RNG.  I find myself having the most success letting the AI do the matches, so actually watching the matches is really...boring after the third time.

The 'x-com' element is really just boils down to how can i make a shot in 3 moves.  If you have an ai opponent that is just smashing you on one saide there aint shit you can do about it until the half.  Any moves you want to make for a defender means you aren't movign the ball up and the same AI will just steal and shoot in the same move.  Boiler player 3 moves per side doesn't cut it.  Maybe 1 move each.  I think the dev's have watched a few matches but don't realize every action on the pitch has a reaction on both ends.  Offsides really isn't a thing.  fouls are just RNG, no slider to effect your chances on how aggressive you want your players.  

the way you level up your 'coaches' with fame is the same way you're leveling players...which is drip fed at a slow pace.  you can get 'maybe' 2-10 fame per match and every upgrade is n+2.  Meaning whatever upgrade, from whatever coach, is going to need 2 more than the last.  By an hour in, each upgrade was 50 fame and I was getting maybe 4 fame?  To upgrade a player its either 2 seasons of play or...200 fame.  At this point I was over my head and nothing I could do but lose.  I ended up leveling up my players, but then when they were retiring the players i could buy were woefully crap.  So I made it to the first league (3->2->1), then had to drop down to the second cause i had to rebuild.  But because I wasn't getting good replacements well I was still losing.  I find myself either woefully underpowered or smashing everything.  

It doesnt make sense that you use fame instead of money to pretty much level up everything.  EPL is known for throwing money at any problem but this is pretty much a no-op.  The jumps in spending are insane.  10k -> 100k -> 370k.  The most I got from a match is maybe 22k.  Most players cost 200-500k.

gameplay loop seems to be simulate all the matches, and inbetween make minor adjustements on injury or training.  End of season buy your new team then hope it was enough carry over.  if not, well you'll relegated to a league you smash so you build up your $$ (not fame) again.  

to the devs, who gives a fuck about face engine when you don't even see your players on the pitch.  I didn't even realize that one of my star players had a mowhawk until I had to renew the contract.  You're exponential costs for upgrades is absured.  Make coaches like players where you hire/fire them.  Remove the fame system and make everything money.  If you want to keep fame, then do it in building your arena more.  Use it to attract fans.  Why can't I build buildings?  Where is the training camp.  Where is the locker room.  Where is the coaches meeting room.  There is absolutely no reason for me to keep a player at age 34 when he retires in a year when I can ax him for a 6 figure payout most times.  When a player retires with the team, that's fame.  When Thierry Henry retired he got a statue.  When Ian Wright retired there were documentaries.  When a player retires here, he's just deleted.  Fame in real life is built by the player sticking with the club and it's ignored.

I really want to like this game.  I will come back to this but for now it's not enough.  Even the demo isn't enough. It gets you from league 3 to 2 which is just a cakewalk.  I won the league by simulating every match and made 2 changes to player positions at the start.",1505333270,1505334261,False,6,0,0.5226505398750305,0,True,False,True,False,,1505374657.0,"It's a pity that your first experience with the game wasn't good. However, I hope, you will change your mind later when you master the game. 

I want only make few notes which might show you that the game is not what it seemed.

1) Football Tactics gives you the easier way to manage your club than Football Manager. But it is not a casual game in the meaning of easy wins, easy promotion etc. Football Tactics is a football world which lives by itself. And you as a manager have different ways to develop your club.

You can try for the fast promoting from league to league, but it has the consequences. You can slowly build the foundation of your club, but it's slow. You can develop through the transfer or through the Youth Academy. You can be a footballers' farm (train weak players and sell them for big money) etc.

Sure, you have to know how the game works to make better decisions. Mastering the game is part of having fun.

2) The Amateur league is simple and has no tactics. But winning in the higher leagues requires tactical approach: using skills, previewing the opponent and finding his weak spots to counter them. Every match needs a preparation. 

Coach's notes describe the tactical elements, but I'll leave there few important notes about skills:
- train skills for your players
- learn how skills work and use them a lot because they give +1 actions for your team if performed successfully _against an opponent_
- in the first turn after kick off the skills are not available because players have to concentrate

Watching is a good mode when you know what are you doing when you prepared your team for the match. Also, if you have players with the skills, watching how AI plays with your team might help you to understand how to play better. We taught our AI how to better use different tactical possibilities.

3) Again, read the coach's notes, they explain many important things. For example, fouls are not just random. They depend on the direction of the tackle. They depend on what action or skill do you use to tackle (Sliding tackle is more probably end in foul than usual Tackle). There are many other things to take into account regarding tackles and bookings. Also, there are offsides.

4) If you don't like the RNG, start a new campaign and select ""Less random"" option. It makes the results more dependent on the players' attributes. The matches become more predictable. 

5) Amount of fame depends on the league you play, on the goal difference, on the opponent's power. It's hard to earn fame, but it's the same in real life as well. Also, as FT is not a casual game which allows for easy and unfair progression, upgrading the trainers is not granted. The better you play, the more possibilities you have to improve your club. As FT is a strategy, you have different ways to develop. You can put all the fame in the Forwards' Trainer, or put it in the Transfers assistant, or make all trainers average. Your choices make the club develop differently.

6) You can make money not only by selling tickets to matches. There are sponsors, for example. Select less risky conditions (like money for every match) to earn at least something. Also, you can sell your best players. It's a very good way to earn money in the real life as well. Especially for the lower league clubs. 

7) One of the important steps in the gameplay loop is preparing to the next opponent. Without it, you just blindly send your players to the match with hopes for the victory. However, the game gives many ""tools"" to counter the opponents' formations. Put your forwards against the weaker defenders. Learn how different skills work, and use players with the skills in the places, where these skills are most effective. Make a good defense. 

Simulating the matches is a good way of playing only if you know what is happening in the match. When you master the mechanics, when you know how the skills work, how to position your players, you will be able to predict how the match will go. Simulating matches is the same as watching matches. AI makes the same things but you spend less time. So when watching matches end as you planned, you can start simulating them. And so your preparation for every match matters a lot.

Without understanding how to outsmart opponents tactically, simulating matches is a roulette which is not fun.

8) We are still working on the updates. And soon (around 1 month) we will release a huge update which will make the game even deeper and much much more tactical. 

You can play a beta version of the update. It is still rough on the corners but main new features work. Also, the beta has a footballpedia which explains game mechanics in details.

Hope, you will give the game another chance. We know that the game did not explain its depth well. That's why we have many negative reviews from the players who played 3-5 hours, and many positive reviews from those, who played 20-200 hours. We will improve the tutorials in the next update. Meanwhile, I'm open to help and answer the questions. FT is our dream game, we have a lot of fun playing it, many players have a lot of fun playing it. And it would be a pity if someone dropped the game not having a chance to understand how fun it is.",375530

A lot of the classes need fixed.

AQ3D was created with the intention of being a casual and fun game you play with your friends.

A monster can still hit you if you are in range or in the same map - you would need to kill it or leave that map. The are specific parts of the game that are quite challenging that you are supposed to battle through with a group of other players and that are not intended to be played solo. There are some challenges that are meant to be played solo, as they are supposed to be challenge. It seems you are having trouble with this, we suggest to keep trying or ask friends for tips how they beat it! 

The devs just added more parkour and a work around for mobile players. They are also working on improving and tweaking mobile controls. We aren't sure what bugs you are referring to, please make sure you are reporting them via artix.com/devs as devs can't fix bugs they aren't aware of and that weren't reported. New content is always tested by the tester team, but sometimes there are bugs they don't catch or that they just don't see on their end yet. This is why we have a bug report system and a bug team who checks reports daily and escalates bugs to get fixed. 

AQ3D is free to play, players do not have to pay anything to play the game, progress in the game or earn and purchase awesome gear. The Guardian upgrades are a one time fee that gives you multiple rewards and bonuses (not just a class and a title) for helping to support the game and is completely optional to purchase.

Artix Entertainment is an indie game studio - comparing us to huge Triple A games such as World of Warcraft, Guilds Wars 2 and Final Fantasy online is quite an honor. Many of the devs play these games and are inspired by them! AQ3D is definitely more 'bite size' compared to them, but we have quite grand plans for the future! These games have also been out for many years and do not have weekly releases like we do. The devs work very hard to fix issues, update the game and release new content weekly.

As a cardgame, this makes a poor turn based strategy game... and as a turn based strategy game, this is a terrible deckbuilder.  We really have the worst of both worlds here.  The game is set in the lacklustre and uninteresting ""Sword of the Stars"" universe, which you'll be passingly familiar with as the developers shove this into every single game bundle and discount they can manage, either to try scrape a few more cents out of a franchise on life support, or just in the hopes that someone buying a game bundle will see one of their games and then suddenly everything will ""Go viral"".  Spoiler:  Nothing went viral. 

The technical implementation is really weak here, I'll get into the specifics later in this review, but the point is that the depth of the game is lost on the majority of gamers who are understandably turned away from the almost browser-esque graphics.   If you did invest time in the game, which I certainly don't recommend, you'll still be disappointed.  Unfortunately, most piles of rubbish on Steam aren't hiding a pot of gold underneath their ugly veneers, and this is no exception. 

One of the big problems here is in terms of the general design and the way it was designed to look and feel like a boardgame, instead of a PC game.  There's two aspects of any game.  The mechanics of the game, and the interface that the players have with that mechanic. Poker, for example, is about randomly generated hands that players get, and the interface is the randomly drawn paper cards.  If you keep the random hand, but remove the physical cards, the game still works, but it's streamlined, more pure.  That's video gaming.  The best video games put the players directly against the core game mechanic.  We don't love games because of their interfaces, we love them for their mechanics.  The less that the interface gets in the way, the better.  So here, we have a boardgame/cardgame, and the focus of the developers has clearly been to keep, and emulate the annoying physical interface, without bothering to improve on the mechanics or put the players closer to them.  As a result of this hamfisted decision, the game is clunky and annoying to play compared to games that were designed from scratch to be PC games.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The game features mostly static, barely animated 2D images, the kind of thing you expect to see in browser/flash games.  While the artwork itself, while mediocre, might be considered passable, the visual presentation here is negligible, it might as well be a slideshow or a Youtube video.  Pac-Man, Space Invaders and Asteroids had more advanced animation and visuals going on than this game does.

The developers didn't design the game for modern gaming PCs, as such the display resolution caps out at around 1440p, there's no support for the state-of-the-art 4K or higher resolutions.  The game simply won't look right on modern gaming displays due to this failure on the part of the developers.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the game is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  Ground Pounders has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for completing the tutorial (and you can't really play the game properly without doing that), but less than 9 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 9 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing the game?  Trading cards.  Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.

Thank you for writing this review.

Space Engineers is a complex game, which was designed to give players a lot of freedom.

When it comes to single-player, there several Survival scenarios to choose from, a Creative mode where players have the choice to build nearly anything they can imagine and there are also an extensive amount of mods available for game.

Additionally, Space Engineers has a thriving multiplayer community, where people come up with a wide range of scenarios.

We're currently focused on polishing existing features and optimizing multiplayer  in Space Engineers. However, once this is completed, we will have more resources available to reevaluate Survival. There will also be additional features added to the game in the long-term future; this includes new blocks as well.

Kind regards,

Im in the tutorial and im so frustrated by the controls, it just makes no sense.

I am supposed to pick up an item from the ground by standing still on an item but holding the sprint button (which is just contradictory), and press C to add it to my inventory for some reason, while my inventory opens with W. In the inventory you have to press CTRL to switch items per example. The tutorial then asks to place a crate, but items are automatically thrown away when you release the button, so you have to hold the button or the item will be thrown. To place the crate on the ground, you have to throw it upwards, which is a strange solution but alright. Then I get a weapon and I am supposed to attack with it by sprinting and jumping at the same time (???) It just all feels so wrong, the hotkeys chosen, the way they need to be executed, so much feels wrong, im sorry. I rather watch someone play it than play it myself. 

Also why does the 30seconds intro play every time ?
Edit: You can close the intro with pressing ""X""

@Devs, you really need to rework this control system, its a total mess and breaks all conventions of what people know about controlling a platformer. Its strange, complicated, unintuitive and makes me want to stop the game before ending the tutorial. Keys are somewhat rebindable but these are mostly that can not be fixed by changing keys.

You've only played 30 minutes, barely enough time to even scratch the surface of this game or it's controls, or why they were made this way.

You claim that you can't jump off the wall ""like in super meat boy"". If you played this game longer than 30 minutes you'd have easily figured out this can be done with jump potions/aura. Comparing this game's controls to simple twitch platformers like meat boy is like asking why a roguelike isn't as simple as pacman. It's simply an invalid comparison. There's much more that can be done in this game. Here's a quote from someone with 500+ hours playtime: 

""People have complained that the controls are very inconvenient and don't make very much sense. Trust me, they do, and you'll get the hang of it with some practice."" 

Play, and you'll see that the controls make sense once you understand the game and it's nuances. There's a lot of subtle things you can do. This game is very strategic, complex, and vast. Do not expect to be good at the game in 30 minutes.

You claim throwing the crate upwards is the only way to place it on the ground. You can simply hold down and drop it. Since the tutorial didn't tell you this word for word, you thought you could only place it by throwing it straight up.

You claim the intro plays every time. You can skip it by pressing jump.

You claim switching items with CTRL isn't explained, when it VERY CLEARLY is.

You simply got frustrated at a game you didn't play, and a control scheme you didn't immediately understand, and left a negative review full of misformation, based on controls you don't understand. There's a reason many people say this game is among their all time favorites; just read any reviews with actual playtime.

If you get frustrated by learning a unique control scheme then this game might be too much for you. Complete the game, then come back and say the controls don't make sense. You won't if you get that far.",396640

- Gameplay is kinda nice, there's a lot to be improved, but its in a good place. 
- Every 10 levels you unlock a new character and weapon. 
- There are a few maps, half of them a bit unoptimized. 
- Low poly graphics, some would say its shit, some would say its the game's charm. 
- A few graphics settings, like resolution, bloom, shadows, postprocessing, but if you look into appdata files you can mess with a few other things. 
- No control settings, you gotta put up with the game's default controls. They're not the worst, but I would like to set them to something more comfortable for me.
- The most annoying thing for me is the huge ""Delete save game"" button, that is inconveniently placed below start and there is no confirmation after you click it, so you might end up starting all over again.

I have to say, i had lots of fun now, playing the game, finding the right way. So i recommend  it now for a buy. But keep in mind, it is still buggy and the english voice is hard to understand. But the gameplay is something fresh and nice. I hope the dev. will fix the remaining problems, but he is on the right way.

New gameplay video (sorry for the bad quality):

Outdated first review:

I really can not say much about this game. You are driving a car in a foggy night on a field of planks between rocks. But every time i move a few metres the car stucks on anything which is near. Then, it needs a level reload. Two times, i could pass the rocks, both times i got stuck shortly later. This could be a fun game if this would not happen, but right now, it is unplayable.

UPDATE: After many, many tries, i could finish the first level. After that, the game is playable. Still many situations where the car got stuck, but doable after a few tries. So i was able to finish the game. If the game would work and had a story, both things, that the dev is working on right now, it would be a nice little game. So, if you see, that there is an update, that fixes this problems, consider a buy, until then, only the hardcore gamer can try it.

Thank you for leaving a review. Any questions you have are better asked on the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/690830/discussions/0/]forums[/url] or our [url=https://discord.gg/foundation]Discord[/url] server as the review section is limited to the support we can give.

To try and answer your issue. As per the details in the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/690830/announcements/detail/2591209246719491239]announcement[/url] Iron now needs to be prospected for as part of the new discoverable mineral deposits. Once a deposit is within range of your territory you can send the bailiff off to prospect the deposits. Currently all minerals can be found on a map so it is likely you haven't reached all deposits.
You can see the deposits if you switch on the minerals layer in the layers menu bottom left.

Once prospected you can then click on the mineral deposit to build a quarry.

We hope that helps but if you have further questions please create a thread in the forums or ask in our Discord server.

Cheers

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. Two of these are completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

These things can be fixed. What I think won't be fixed is the housing system. The game lets you select the residential area where your peasants/citizens can build however they like. Which is an issue. It is supposed to be ""natural"" but it is more ""chaotic"". They just build the most random way. Which does not look good most of the time.

Some warehouses and granaries hold mats to be sold both on your markets and trading. You need to build quite a lot of them in order to get many mats stacked up. It would have been much better if you could upgrade them at least once, for the sake of visual because at that point your citizens have stone buildings and these are still wooden and look barebones and for the quality of life reasons.

I could honestly go on and on about these things. I am a bit pessimistic about the future of this game because most of the problems lay withing the foundation of the game. I am not sure how willing the devs are about going back and fixing stuff.

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. 

The granary requires 15 wood and 5 stone to build. It does not require planks. Perhaps you have added a mod that changes those resource requirements?
Incidentally the sawmill to create planks also only requires wood (20) and stone (10).

Over all It is a very nice start to a game but, as it is brand new (on early access) it has a few glarring issues: 
1) I could not get it to load a larger map... it just sat at the loading screen for about 10 minutes before i gave up and alt-ctrl-del it. but the quick start did work fine
2) some graphical issues when playing on a rig with dual monitors.
3) a few quality of life things that would make the game a lot easier to play well at(being able to have a list of all your depots/loading points/bus stations. being able to search the industries, roads being funky about connecting to eachother(I could go on...)
4) The AI is kinda stupid (as i mentioned i was playing on the quick start version) I took over the AI company and found out only about 25% of their routes were profitable(and about 10% went nowhere... ie a truck picked up cargo, and the route was set up so there was no where for it to be delivered)

We're a very small team, and while our internal testing was solid, we had unexpected issues come out as the game hit a wide number of systems. 

We have just released a blog that explains our priority right now, number one being the save game issue. It would be great if you could check it out here: http://steamcommunity.com/games/365450/announcements/detail/132083641497684826

Also, I'd love to just chat and apologise for the issues you had. Please contact me on community AT surpriseattackgames DOT com, or add me on Steam.

Thanks again!

Yes, this is like subnautica in a lot of ways, but much, much, much more tedious.  I haven't gotten far, admittedly, but I don't feel like I want to. Here are some reasons:

1. Oxygen is much more punishing than in Subnautica. You can get a better tank, but it doesn't help much. You can craft consumable oxygen pots, but they don't last long. You can create oxygen stations that have a finite amount of oxygen that will refill you, and then you can refill those with disposable oxygen generators. Sounds ok at first, but...

2. Item durability is horrendous. You can't repair for cheap, so each item breaks down completely, needing a new one. So you need to get more materials to make the most basic of tools, to then make oxygen less of a problem. Problem is, oxygen again depletes quickly. So you will find yourself running in circles more than moving forward, replacing things to get you to further areas to collect things to replace things, etc. Which brings me to the next issue...

3. Many resources look the same. Ice and glass? Look the same, and you will have to be drunk to find glass, so your vision is blurry. Yea, alcohol heats you up and glass is in an icy area. While trying to get it you are also fighting oxygen as it is quite a ways away (see above again regarding the oxygen issue). 

4. Knowing what to get, and where to get it is not really even hinted at for the most part. Which means you will have to explore every nook and cranny, which again causes you to fight the oxygen mechanic. 

The game, and maybe it is just the first couple hours, is so tedious that it made me not want to continue. And I've played some tedious games. There is humor in the game, but it really isn't enough to make you want to continue.",1614481626,1614481626,False,4,0,0.5060611367225646,0,True,False,False,False,,1617109949.0,"Hey there!

Sorry about this trouble!

We recently found out that some players with AMD cards are having an issue very similar to what you're describing. 

Would it be possible for you to check if you also have an AMD card and if any of these processes are running when you start up Game Dev Tycoon?

Unfortunatelly the game never really added much more and only fixed issues however complex those might have been to fix or not I will not judge but I will judge the content after my return since it's release.

First of I only have 5 hours in the game because there just isn't a whole lot to do if you follow the right order in what to build first it's simple even with the random events, 4 possible as far as I know 3 of those are natural causes which are al neutralizable in the end and never crippled me personally the only one which kept being annoying was the armed thugs just landing and entering.

I will list the pros and cons next:

+ Base building
+ Simple mechanics
+ Good Graphics

- Too Simple
- Still quite buggy
- Clearly not finished (even if the devs claim it is)
- No real goal to work for
- Interface

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here I will explain some of the points for those that care to read about them.

The pros first then,
+Base building, for me any game with base building is a good game on average so that is just a preference.
+Simple Mechanics, the games mechanics are easy to understand and don't really require explanation imo.
+Good Graphics, the game looks good.

-Too Simple, now here I feel the game loses most points for me because these parts feel lazy. You cannot rotate buildings and yes I can hear others say ""but the buildings are round"" but at the start your airlock building is not and the ground collision model seems to be a hexagon rather the circle which is especially noticable when building near hills so yes it is important for those that want a tight look. There are no other building options to make the base look clean such as align to grid for example. 

 You can also unlock tech upgrades via trading and once aquired you might want to get rid of the slightly smaller but clearly obsolete versions but to do that you need to breakdown half your base in some instances, they should have allowed you to remove anything you want but that that other part becomes unpowered or unaccessable until it is reconnected or w/e. Units would not work on a schedule to relieve one another which could often cause systems to go offline for a while before another would take over the duties (think anti asteroid lasers).

If you think Japan loves standing in line to wait for something then I got to tell you the colonists here love it more, I added several airlocks on one massive storage node to help with congestion but they would still take one because ""shortest routing programming"" (also why can only 1 go in an airlock clearly big enough for 3 at a time or make a double airlock to make that go faster because that part killed a lot of my population often)

- Still quite buggy, Often AI will walk outise without a pressure suit and not using an airlock no they just plop through the walls and at one point a lot of the people and robots would refuse to move things around for no reason visable to the player. sometimes there where other random bugs but those where rare and not as game breaking.

- No real goal, Other then building a succesful base there is no real goal given or explained so currently when you have a fully functional base the game it's plan is to have to colonize another planet and repeat what you just did with no real variation. Why is there no little vid that shows a slideshow of images and text showing proud colonists and text congratulating you on pushing the boundries for the whole of mankind or something in such a style?

- Interface, Everything consists of vague icons and everything is under a menu so eventhough there can be a crisis you have to go through 3 menus to hit red alert which is just super silly... why would I have guards and stations if they cannot decide that themselfs or at least have 3 colored dots in the top or bottom of my screen? It's never good to have things in too many menus is just makes it feel clunky and causes unnecessary slowdowns in gameplay.

Because of all this and even having enjoyed the time I played I cannot recommend the game as it just is not finished (NO ITS NOT).  Get the game when its like 5 euros or w/e your regional equivalent is because if they don't want to make a game that is 100% then they don't deserve 100% of the price.

I hope this helps ya nerds out there, peace.",1516959912,1516959912,False,24,0,0.6890168190002441,0,True,False,False,False,,1519032492.0,"Hello,

A mediocre and boring RPG.

The developer is overzealous about policing the reviews, often dismissing legitimate concerns as ""trolling"" or flagging the review as off-topic. The recent steam review overhaul seems to have removed the erroneous flags however.

I get it, it's tough to take criticism about something you created, but this type of behavior is not doing you any favors. Just let the negative reviews be.

In the beginning it was a fun vehicle shooter where you could build whatever ride you felt like, for the most part. Sure have always been able to buy better stuff faster but that has with time become more and more important. Today you pretty much have to do that because you are teamed up with and against people that have so much better weapons that you do. Forget about the power score, that doesn't mean much. This is pay to win on steroids. You're queueing a small car with shotguns or machine guns and are teamed up against railguns that are what tier 3-4 or something. Ludicrous. 

So you can get better and buy better parts right? Yes but it takes literally ages. And during that time you will be steamrolled into the dirt over and over. Just not fun.

In it's base form there is a good game. Fun, nice physics and destruction models but it's all destroyed because of pay to win, bad matchmaking and grinding. Such a shame.

Edit after dev response:
Yeah, all those points are addressed in my review. 

Yes you can obtain the parts without spending real money. But that takes ages and during that time you are steamrolled by people with better parts all the time. Not fun.

Matchmaking, yes, that sounds good and all but the advantage of having better weapons is greater than having less durability. People are making glass cannons and are very effective doing it. So power score doesn't mean much as I said. It would have been wiser having matchmaking in tiers instead of by power score so you don't get steamrolled by people with better parts.

Sorry, not convinced at all.

Oh and I guess I missed mentioning that paying for the vehicles that you can buy with real money are very expensive. Pretty much all of them cost as much as a full game on the PC.

If this game had been somewhat fair I would have kept coming back to it. This time was probably the last.",1616354014,1617127832,False,0,1,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,1617085293.0,"Hello!
All parts that affect to the battle can be obtain in-game ways: as the rewards for leveling up or you can buy them on the in-game market. So you don't need to spend any real money to get a weapon, a cabin and so on.
Speaking about matchmaking system: it based on Power Score of your and other players vehicles. That means if enemy has weapon with higher Power Score then he has less durability. You can find a key to each enemy.",386180

BUGS!!!!

I Play Space Engineer (and its medieval brother) since release and ever since it is the same Pattern: I start playing having fun  and get more and more annoyed by game breaking bugs that make my constructions self destroy in one way or the other. I unistall the game and try again a few Months Later

Literally Space Engineers has more Bugs than features and while Keen House Software is great at adding new content they never seem to be able to get a stable version out. And i dont speak about ""minor"" things like ""Rubber banding"" or Low Simulation speed. I speak about stuff like Thrusters suddendly stop working without reason,  Conveyor Tubes becoming super Magnets, Welding Blueprints making you crash or Best over all: Tiny Voxel parts of an Asteroid suddednly appearing INSIDE your ship and becoming a nuclear explosion... Each of these things happened mutiple times in different servers, singleplayer games or even the campaign.

As i said Space Engineers could be such a wonderful game, but the bugs became so unbearable frustrating over time that one just cant stand it. 

And yes i write this review while being slightly pissed (and after unistalling once again) but since i am usual a very calm, very patient, VERY forgiving person i assume that me unistalling a game out oif frustration could count as a heavy argument,too.

I would hope Keen House fixes the stuff someday, but after a few years of waiting and trying again and again and again i kinda doubt it by now",1552565007,1552565007,False,3,0,0.477885365486145,0,False,False,False,False,,1552579221.0,"Hi [82DK-✠]Warrior044,

CONS:
- Long loading time at the start
- Annoying voices / narration during gameplay
- Does not have the charm of the old dungeon keeper 2
- Pace is much quicker than the old one (this bothers me a lot) 
- Creatures level up quickly and they do not seem to have special abilities when at high levels (unless I am missing something?)
- Not enough attention to detail - especially when it comes to the creatures in your dungeon (this was a big thing in the old one)
- I do not like the ""beast"" concept
- Game got very laggy during the second last campaign mission. Probably because there are 4 dungeon keepers on the one map. Very frustrating.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2016. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. One of these is completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate
- Entirely new Skirmish AI

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Cian

In Planetbase the AI follows some simple rules, that (hopefully) should be easy to understand: the first tend to their needs: food, drink sleep, morale, then they do work, if they can (all the components, resources are there etc...)

The idea behind the game is that once you understand their behaviour you should be able to indirectly manipulate them, to do what you want, just like you would do in real life if you were managing a bunch of people.

We understand that this kind of gameplay is not to everyine's liking, and some people would prefer more micromanagement, but we wanted to try something a bit different in terms of gameplay for this game.

I've been playing the standalones released on reddit as soon as they were up and had fun for hours and hours, and now it's on steam!

It's been fun to watch it develop from a custom game on a different engine to coming here onto steam.  The idea of a standalone version is great.  It's still an early release, so the graphics and a few things are limited, and the interface could still use some work.

However, here's some things I really love overall:

- The ability to attack map points is great.  
- Getting resources for each area you attack is great! Being able to upgrade them as you see fit is very cool.  Instead of just conquering a map, there's some strategy to it.
- Right now it's down to being able to buy one other builder, but in the SC2 version there's a ton of builders, I'm hoping to see more, but being able to buy them with in game resources is very cool.  The fact that it's an option in single player is nice.
- The ability to buy spells in the middle of the game is great and makes it for a huge game changer.  Sometimes units may not cut it on a wave and in a bind you may find yourself using a fireball, or regeneration, maybe you need rage, or the other plethora of spells that are available (there is a lot!).
- Buying spells in game gives you more gold income, and so does upgrading your keep, and it is actually very useful and splits towards ""the keep"" after a round (to help upgrade that area, or others you've attacked).
- The interface is simple so far, and while the buttons are really really big, it's still easy to use and is easy enough laid out to use in a manner that makes sense from a starting sense.
- The units at your disposal make it enough that you can almost always come up with a combo to complete a level, depending on how strategic you lay your stuff out, upgrade, and mix spells with your mines or keep.  While it is random, it is at least difficult enough to provide a challenge if you are patient and take the time to get to know the game.  In the first round it seems like it's almost all on unit composition, and later on as you progress you'll quickly realize just how important the spells become, which makes it balanced to stay strategic and thinking on your feet and ahead.

Some things I hope we'll see in the future:

- The mine zap button kind of pops up in inopportune places when you click it, and am hoping that may improve, or become hotkeyed (such as within the sc2 version).  
- Ability to upgrade zaps? or apply spells to it? (a slow or poison zap would be cool, at cost, of course)
- The buttons are pretty huge and makes the screen seem like you're zoomed way in by comparison of the UI.  It's not bad and this is still an early release, and it is laid out well so things aren't in the way.
- Hotkeys for everything
- More units for a more diverse army would be a plus, though at this moment in time still is a great little layout.
- It would be really helpful to see the hp of units and stats of them as they fight to see and figure out numbers to crunch numbers for the best layout for next rounds.
- Being able to upgrade units into different types would be cool as well, but again, this is early release and the dev has enough on their plate.  It's incredible that they've done this much so fast.  The map is awesome!

All in all this dev is on top of stuff, has been working on the SC2 version for a while (I hope they don't stop because it's AWESOME), and is dedicated to the development of this.  It is so incredibly cool to see them go for a standalone.  This is a great little time killer if you like a map conquer strategy game, and with stuff to do, lots of spells, and something to pass the time.  Since this is essentially a tower defense map there isn't really any lore or quests that go with it, which is fine since these types of maps don't really tend to be that sort of thing.

Stellar and appreciated. This game is money well spent. If you like banished, sim city, stronghold, or any other city builder you will not be disappointed. Bummed I waited so long.

So much potential, and I look forward to updating my review as it evolves. This may literally end up being one of my favorite city builders of all time by the end, however after pouring in literally hundreds of hours I still cannot figure out how housing works. Yes I have read all the discussions about it and even created one of my own, but just when I think I've pinned down all the ""rules"" for where a villager will build I create a zone that no matter how close to workplaces, how high quality, or how large it is they just won't build there. I think it must be bugged because it is completely unpredictable. I understand the desire to have cities have a ""holistic"" feeling and therefore not allowing players to define roads, but this is a digital zen garden, it should at the bare minimum be predictable. Also the pathing that villagers choose just because there is a pre-existing path is pretty ridiculous sometimes. they will go around three edges of a square on an existing path instead of blazing a new path down the one side of the square. 

Two changes would make this a 9/10 for me even in it's early state. 

1) Allow players to build houses. Don't do away with residential zones that build wherever for only 10 wood,  but for those who want a house in a particular spot why not let them? You could even make it a little bit more expensive late game option. A mayor/landlord certainly could do this back in the day. Why not in this game?

 2) Allow players to build roads (perhaps at the cost of stone?) and have the villagers prefer roads (albeit perhaps less heavily than they currently prefer paths). Bottom line is forcing player to play your way doesn't work out well. If someone wants to grid their city at the cost of efficiency they should be able to.",1588564515,1588701747,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,True,False,,1588695464.0,"Hi Lokius

Thank you for the positive review! 

With regards to the housing, this is still a work in progress and not yet complete. There will be further improvements and iterations as we continue to develop the game and hopefully you will enjoy the improvements. It is unlikely that we will allow for manual placements of housing as this is currently a feature of the game but it will be improved upon. If you are trying to place an individual house in a small zone this may be what is causing your issue but we would be happy to take a look at your save if you need further help.

With regards to roads we are looking at improvements to these as well. You can see a little info in our [url=https://trello.com/b/i5AX944p/foundation-roadmap]trello[/url] roadmap.
If you wish to create a new path for villagers it is possible to temporarily block an old path with the red restricted zone. Once the new path has been created you can remove the zoning and the shortest path will be used depending on the villagers destination. Potentially both paths might be used. You can also remove pathing permanently with this and the grass will slowly grow back over time. 

If you require any further help you can request help on the discussion forums or reach us on our [url=https://discord.gg/Foundation]Discord[/url] server or via email at support@polymorph.games.

Initially there was an issue where players were spawning into my games in a crumpled heap that couldn't quite be interacted with.  As you can see from the developer comment below, that issue was swiftly corrected and I managed to get some online multiplayer action.  SkutteOleg is very much on top of matters, so make sure to list an issue if you find one.

Drunken Wrestlers 2 is loaded with potential and the developer is worthy of support.


The intentionally awkward character controls are a good time to be had, having your wrestler stumble around for balance and trying to land a shot on whomever is nearest is a treat.  The insanity of the impacts feels real nice and satisfying, as well as being completely over the top in the physics and limb dismemberment. 

The in game sounds, like the rest of the game, are comedically over-the-top.  The thuds, rips and impacts really fit with the goofy theme of the title, as well as the soundtrack fitting well into the setting without getting annoying or repetitive.


I really can't find much to complain about as far as the cons go.
The bulk of the I have are minor nitpicks that I suspect are the result of the game still being in development.

The only thing that I don't like too much is that the shift in camera angle can sometimes be jarring and cause you to lose sight of your wrestler in kickboxing mode and that it's a little frustrating starting the fight laying down (as it can be pretty difficult to get onto your feet again and your opponents have an advantage if they can get up first)

The AI bot is a little too overpowered as well, but again, this is just me struggling to find nitpicks.

I'm fine with bugs in a generaly working game, really. But as of right now I'm simply not able to play it properly.

- had to restart several times before it even reacted to the language-option.
- in-game start-menu can lead you to a black-screen when you press ""Remember"" (Continue basically) even though you shouldn't e able to
- QWERTY controls would be nice if you were able to change them since you start with AZERTY controls (understandable, it's the french keyboard layout, but please let us change them?)
- Escape menu only reacts to the first mouse-input and then simply ignores everything that follows; so while you are able to press ""Controls"" you can't change the controls in the follow-up window

Dev's seem completely oblivious to the fact that the game has glaring holes, literally, in the mesh. No fresh material, unless you want to count the Pay to Use decor, in years. Same lame gun, same lame blocks, same lack of end game or ambitious reasoning to spend the amount of time required to build and perform anything, and then there is nothing to explore. All servers are really small with no goals for being in space, no fighting AI, no new rewards other than what you can get on the ground. Like so many games it is a pleasant concept with no ambition or long term goals. I did manage to find some mod communities working hard to overcome dev failures, but the game cant really handle modding. It requires massively repetitive resets, usually hourly.

It is a case of the lightning in a bottle, that much can be said. Normally, so many ideas and concepts in one wouldn't translate well, and the dev logs show there is a struggle going on behind the scenes. However, the diamond is there in the dirt, and I wish all the best for the devs.

To devs, if you see this, things to note in the current game state:

1) Colliding mesh, leading to stuck units and unmoving units. Copters have also been stuck in building once
2) Units will go for a hike when you tell them to walk a short distance
3) Cerberus APCs cannot refuel with Supply Atlas for whatever reason
4) I have no idea how EVAC works
5) I played the main game, and not the experimental, but it would neat to have a 'free roam' mode to give people a chance to familiarize with the controls.
6) Power Pylon range needs to be longer, like Resistor long, otherwise it's better to place more generators
7) Supply Atlas should have option to manually select who to supply and who to fuel.
8) A custom army painter would have serious potential in this game

That's all I can think of in the short time I've played this game. I say the above in all seriousness, good faith and passion. You have an amazing game in the making, all the best! It speaks volumes I'm uninstalling, because of how addicting it is. I'll happily reinstall when I have more time to kill. Can't wait for the campaign update.

I loved my firtst playthough. The whole idea of mixing retroshooter with rogelike game is soo much fun. The only thing that bothered me are performance isues.

Fps dropped to 40-50ish in open areas with rain particles.

On the positive side of things, dev seems to be actively involved in community discusions and is aware of the performance isue. Hopefully it will be fixed soon. Going through this game 120 fps stile would be amazing.

At the end some suggestions from my point of view:
Adding more types of enemies would go nicely with the huge gun roaster. To me, the most fun part of the game is combat itself, yet I felt some of levels were just bit short on the enemy numbers so I would like to see some sort of arena, or bigger levels where you can go absolutely ham and gore tons of monsters with your weapons of choice. And for last sugestion... mod support. Things like community made map chunks, weapons, ememies etc )replayability) and this game would suddenly be my nunumber 1

And what a welcome blast from the past it is indeed.  Following the travels and trials of Horatio and Crispin, this game tells an amazing story with all the conventions of the P&C genre.  But it's not QUITE to same as the games of old, such as King's Quest, or Broken Sword.

For starters, the game tells you outright that you cannot die, or can you take an action that renders the game ""unwinnable"", a flaw that made many of the classic staples of point-and-click, like King's Quest 5, atrocities of game design.  The locales don't require meticulous pixel hunts to find that one item you need in order to progress.  Travelling the maps is expidited by a fast-travel system that easily lets you jump from place to place.  Combining items is no longer a nonsensical MacGuyver mish-mash of parts, it's all explained and makes perfect sense.  No longer do you need a notebook to take down vital information, a handy item in-game records all the most relevant information for you, and your helper will at times offer a light nudge towards the next possible objective.

And that's just the mechanics.  The game's art and sound, two of the major foundations of point-and-click, which lives and thrives (or fails and dies) off it's atmosphere, are in full force.  The discoloration of the game's settings isn't just to be ""realistic"", it's a compliment to the setting and aesthetic.  And the music is highly atmospheric.  From the haunting melody of the game's menu theme ""Primordia"" to the tune of ""The City of Glass and Light"", the music compliments the setting as much as the color palette.  The characters are all fully voiced, and the voice work is clean and quality, with voices befitting each character and role.

Of course, Primordia isn't perfect.  For starters, the biggest and possibly most glaring flaw, is just how SHORT the game is.  Even if the puzzles make you spend extra time (and at first, they will), you'll likely only wind up spending 5-7 hours on this game.  It's basically over before it seems to really begin.  While it follows the classic story-telling formula, the climax of the story seems to be on you before you know it.  A point in the game that feels like the 50% is more like the 75% mark instead.  And before you know it, you're already at the final scene.  Even with multiple endings (which can be achieved by just reloading and making a different choice) the game feels painfully short-lived.  You'll be left wanting to hear and see more.

The music, while perfectly fitting the mood, never seems to stick with the player much.  I couldn't tell you a moment in the game and point out the music for it, besides the music at the main menu.  Which isn't to say the music is bad, because it's not.  But it's not catchy much.  Or very present.  The music mostly serves as a background to the game, ambience.  And it does it's part amazingly well.  I just wish that perhaps the music felt a bit more powerful at certain scenes.  Speaking of sound, the voice-acting and sound effects are a bit off as well.  Some scenes would have effects, like gunshots, with NO sound accompanying them, which removed something important to the scene.  And the voice actors themselves, while very good, still felt a bit rough.  Horatio's voice actor in particular, either does a stellar job, or seems a bit too stoic when you'd think a situation would call for a more forceful, emotional or venomous delivery.

Overall though, Primordia definitely feels like it was a game that SHOULD have existed back in the Golden Age of the adventure genre of PC gaming.  It feels like a game that I missed from my childhood and I'm just getting to sit down and enjoy it now for the first time in years, and it's not even that old!  But it takes me back to that time in gaming that I've almost forgotten and reminded me of what games I use to partake of, and that's a feeling I can't being to say how much I enjoy.  If you are a person who enjoys the point-and-click genre, grew up in that era, or want a relaxing, easy-paced game that can still deliver a great story, Primordia is worth every possible virtual cent you pay for it.",1385677288,1385677288,True,1,0,0.0,0,False,False,False,False,,,,227000

GoI Online is an excellent game. Alliance adds, on top of the PvP mode, a PvE play option. It adds some new content, in the form of new missions and Special Abilities, but the base gameplay is the same -- but the opponents are bots. And if you've played Online, you know that fighting bot captains isn't fun because they are dumb. It doesn't matter how many you have to fight at once, or if they add boss fights. The captains are still bots.

On top of that, playing PvE matches is a near necessity for advancing in the ""overgame"" (as I will call it; it has no official name as far as I know). On the surface, this third mode of play is the coolest mechanic ever -- a global, risk-style map that makes every game worthwhile, and adds a depth of strategy above the round-to-round combat. In practice, this discourages playing the better gamemode -- PvP -- in favor of MMO style grinding. Competitive MMO style grinding.

Consider what would happen if we replaced all the progress made by playing PvE with just a meter that automatically filled depending on what you targetted. The overgame now appears vividly hollow. Go back to how it is, and it is that, but with incentive to grind.

Only buy this version if you absolutely love the base game and are craving for more content or want to support the developers. GoIO deserves it.",1510694888,1513386360,False,4,0,0.5349344611167907,3,True,False,False,False,,1515614119.0,"Ohai!

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2017. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. One of these is completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate
- Entirely new Skirmish AI

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Cian

Therefore I was stuck in something that maybe is a bug? because certainly i checked every menu, upgraded every building and was lost for more than 10 min skipping storms trying to see if that would be an event that has to be triggered later, idk. Nothing worked. So yeah, maybe buggy.. idk 

I mean, still appreciate they tried to do their gig. They just went the small-studio route of targeting mobile gamers since they're a pretty big market it seems. But for us PC gamers it is all in your face, the PC UX was not a priority clearly. I feel they should be marketing this on the Appstore instead of Steam.

Thank you for your review!

What was that issue with the tutorial? If it was during еhe sacrifice of the mage phase, than yes, there was a bug that appeared only on some systems and caused the button to disappear. I am sorry that you had this issue, and is already fixed in a 1.1 patch. Also, we do not give an option to skip the tutorial, because this way player would not know the core gameplay mechanic.

I must mention that our main priority was changing the game UI to feel less than a mobile UI and more like a pc one. That is why we got rid of panel in a top bottom part that looked like hp/energy in f2p games. We did simplify game windows, but this was made to get rid of useless space in them that appeared after we changed the core gameplay mechanic.

The changes to the gameplay were made to give player more control over the city and to raise replayability. The game now has dozens of new ways to complete it.

Our goal is to make a strategic roguelike experience for PC platforms, and right now we are not doing a mobile version, because it is not in our priority.

Hope you will give the game one more chance, perhaps with the next patch (ver. 1.3) that is going to be released in a few days!",956060

This game is hot garbage right now with the unbearable amount of bugs even after the Sept 1st update.  I was so anxious to play this game despite the comments about bugs that I went ahead and bought it, at full price even, because I saw they had recently done an update that fixed some bugs.  I didn't see any comments after that date so I tried my luck.  I am so upset that this game was released in this condition.  This game needs a lot of work to even begin to work properly.  I have tried everything to get around the bugs and have just decided this game is simply not playable until the developers do the right thing and get some real work done on fixing bugs.  The job system is completely broken and no matter what job I do, what character I create, the game breaks once it hits tier 2 of the job.  As a florist I went from watering flowers (beginning level) to CEO which was somehow job level 2 ??? and it didn't even tell me what I was to be doing at that point. I just stood around the store to find at the end of the day I made 5 coins as CEO as opposed to the 40 coins I made as flower waterer. Every job broke at job level 2.  On my last experiment as bartending I found that you can't quit some jobs, so you just have to be fired if you want to switch to another job. Your diary also does not keep the information for each job you have worked. One of the biggest issues I have found is with saves. It does something to the game when reloading saves. It showed lost information several times and this last time all of my saves suddenly did not show anything in my inventory anymore, poof gone.  No matter how many times I rebooted.  All my hard earned stuff was gone, FROM PREVIOUS SAVES! LIKE WHAT? This is just the beginning. The people you talk to on the streets only say one of three different things to you. Is this world some kind of lame hive mind?  Come on, there has to be more variety and realism.  I can't even tell people apart, how am I supposed to develop relationships when people are just speeding past me constantly saying the same things over and over. There is no immersion with the places of business such as the nightclub.  You go in and ""dance"" and you get out there to dance but you find that all your character does is stand there while your fun meter fills up and you quickly realize its also an empty night club.  I was expecting much more effort and immersion in those things as well as jobs. It should feel like a real simulation, a real exciting and maybe a bit scary experience in a new city climbing the ranks slowly, not just a jump to crafting your own stuff to make money and foregoing the job system laid out.  That is missing a huge part of the experience.  The game feels empty. You run around quickly trying to beat the clock while filling up your meters.  There is nothing fun or immersive about it.  So disappointed.  I will change my review to a positive one hopefully one day, but for now my blood pressure can't take anymore.  Please developers, a lot of people believe in your project.  Don't give up and please keep working on this game.",1663120160,1663121984,False,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,True,,1663877381.0,"Hello depelocha, first of all we are very sorry you had such an experience.

We would be happy if you could provide us more feedback. Issues that are reported (and the ones we can replicate on our side) we do fix, and we thank each individual for pointing them out.

- Job System. Wahtever we try we can't replicate this bug, job level works on our end fine.
Could you send us your save game file, so we can see what happened on your end?

- We tried several other jobs and non-got broken at level 2. Did you play a particular Scenario or did you lay Free Play Mode?

- Quitting a job, if you go to any Newspaper stand and find your job there (that you are currently doing), there is a ""QUITE JOB"" button.

- NPC's conversations and depth of them are broken down into 5 tires, depending on your relationship level with the NPC, the conversation changes.

- Agree with you on the nightclub thing. Suggestions are welcomed at this point. :)

I'd wait at least a few months before playing this, though honestly I can't see it being in a finished state for at least another 6 months.

Thank you for taking the time to write a review. 

We though you might like to know that the UI, it is undergoing a complete overhaul right now that will include many improvements to the UX. You can check out some teaser images of the current work in progress in the recent Devlog [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/690830/announcements/detail/2745461157458184840]here[/url] as well as more in the recent article from [b][url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/08/14/foundations-updates-and-new-ui-will-make-it-the-city-builder-to-beat/]Rock Paper Shotgun[/url][/b]

Housing is currently still work in progress and will be improved as we further develop the game. There is however, a priority button on all buildings that you can use to prioritise the builders. Doing this on the houses will cut down on the time villagers are waiting for their houses to be built.

Thanks again and we hope you enjoy the further development of the game including the new UI when it lands.

Cheers
Ash",690830

Pros:
 - humor
 - ambience in space
 - relaxing gameplay (as long as you mind your oxigen level)
 - sounds, OST and voice acting is pretty good

Cons:
 - the pacing is strange. basebuilding in the first half is a complex minigame like in Subnautica, but totally optional, it is just there to enjoy it if you want. meanwhile the second half is quite different gameplay-wise, you barely need any crafting, just have to run through the story.

Edit: I have since unlocked everything on the ""skill trees"" and beat all the bosses, and had fun doing it!  Recently (Jan, 2022) there was another free content update with some new bosses, so I paid to buy the DLCs.  The extra characters are....meh....but I think they deserve some money out of me for all the fun I've had.  Have not reached the new bosses yet but I'm working on it!  Original review follows:

Roguelite platformer/shooter with zillions of items and guns, and quite a few pets too. Shoot the badguys, and don't get hit by their shots.  It's nice that many enemies don't damage you on-contact, just from their actual attacks.  At the end of each stage there's a boss fight, and after several stages, there's a big boss called a manager.  So far I only beat the first one. 

5 types of 'currency' in the game:
-HP, which you can sometimes pay directly or indirectly to buy things or access new areas. Restore them by picking up full/half hearts. Moldy hearts may heal or harm you. 
-coins. Gain them as copper(1)/silver(5)/gold(10)/larger
-keys
-grenades / explosions, there are plenty of obstacles that will only disappear/open from explosions. 
-crystals, which you can think of as MP. They are used to power your RMB special ability. 
Some doors/chests can be opened for 3/2 crystals, or you can shoot them to turn them into a 'spiked' version that instead costs 0.5HP to open. 

On a run you can find big yellow coins, which go towards unlocking things on a skill tree including new characters.  Some of the skill-trees end in a one-time-use bonus that seems pretty dumb...the longest skill tree ends in double-jump (one-time-use), though you can sometimes get that, or even flight, from RNGesus during regular gameplay. 

There are several characters you can unlock in-gme (and more you can buy as DLC), they vary in health/shields/keys/grenades and their special abilities.  I like the black guy (default version) that lays landmines.  At the risk of hurting yourself, you effectively have infinite explosions.",1633324690,1643696646,True,1,0,0.5320196747779846,1,False,True,False,False,,,,788100

That said, there are not many games that simulate the the napoleonic wars so well. It certainly is more of an arcadey strategy game but it has a lot of elements of realism like morale, formations and intensive resource management.

First of all I would like to mention that the game has an incredible art style and that the 2d graphics hold up quite well. The units have detailed animations and spritework and coupled with the picturesque maps, it's quite a sight to behold. Although I do have a soft spot for 2d graphics. But having multiple lines of infrantry duking it out feels quite epic.

The game has an extensive campaign, a risk type of world domination mode, skirmish and multiplayer. The campaign is a good introduction but it is tough as nails, in general this game will make you go mad. You always seem outnumbered and resources are dwindling. Even on easy, the campaign is no joke. It's actually more frustrating and I could never finish it.

Skirmish mode provides you with map where you build your hometown, collect resources and then duke it out on the map. While trying to capture resource points. World domination adds an overworld map with various faction that fight over the control of europe. You also have a gamemode where you can replay massive historical battles, then you also got the multiplayer.

The gameplay mostly consists of moving around massive lines of infantry, adapting your formations to various circumstances. Formations are vital for success and also managing the morale of your units. Overall the formation based rts gameplay is quite enjoyable, albeit a bit chaotic at times. Most missions give you units and ressources, where you have to fufill certain objectives. Some missions have base building as well. The base building aspect of the game is a bit weak, gathering resources is a hassle most of the time. Therefore you can capture towns which automatically produce goods. 

My issue with the game itself is that there is no particular gamemode that is really appealing or offers that much replayability. 

The campaign is very frustrating and hard, also there are not many ways to actually fulfill your goals in different ways. Also the dialogues is done in such a boring way that you just want to skip to the gameplay right away. The historical battles are way to massive, it seems like the game is not made to handle such large amount of units to be honest. The player is always struggling to keep the frontline stable and the micromanaging feels like hell. The multiplayer is alright but due to the weak base building, I never particularly liked it. A shame also that you cannot play with a friend against the AI. 

The only decent game mode is the world domination, you pick a faction, gather resources and invade different regions. You spawn with a few regiments and have to conquer the map. This gameplay shines in this gameplay mode, where you can strategize and organise yourself before fighting on a map. Unfortunately, the tougher terrorities are so well defended that at that start of each round, you get rushed by tons of enemies. It's just tedious at some point.

All things considered, I want to like this game and I certainly do but it lacks kind of the rts elements from the first game with a bigger emphasis on the tactical aspect of the formations, still the tactical gameplay is not as refined as Total War games.

It's still worth picking up if you like historical rts games, lots of potential here.",1553458743,1553458743,True,1,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,,,115200

Otherwise, I do not recommend.

I have followed this game company since early 2009. Playing their other games, primarily AQWorlds. I had high hopes for this game, testing it in every testing phase: pre-alpha, alpha, beta, etc. and the game hasn't changed. One bit. The combat is that of when it was first introduced: you target a monster, you spam skills 1, 2, 3, 4 and that's it. There's no missing, no dodging (besides the RNG calculator), it's like the game plays itself. Conclusion: combat is static and boring as all hell. The camera is the same; fix-locked onto your character with no smoothness to it. 

The graphics need a mass update to it. It's like playing a game from the PS1, only with higher anti-analysing and better resolution. 

Questing system isn't much better either (more below).

Want a new class? Takes a week doing a daily quest to collect class tokens and that's it. There's no farming for miscellaneous items or anything. It doesn't feel rewarding; as if you don't deserve the new class. 

Lastly, this game is ALL about cosmetics. As I mentioned in the combat above; you spam skills 1, 2, 3, 4 and that's it. Each class has 4 skills and a passive, and the combat being static, right? Well, that's where cosmetics come in to save the day? No... The majority of cosmetics you obtain through Dragon Coins (the premium currency). This game is a money grab if you want your PS1 rendered character to look good. 

If I had to sum up this game with one word: soulless. There's nothing to make it unique or stand-out from other games.

We appreciate your honest feedback and always take any player feedback or constructive criticism to heart. The devs work very hard on a weekly basis to fix issues, release updates and to improve the game, which is a challenge as we are a small indie game studio.

The devs are working on updating combat, quests and improving graphics. You can always tweak your camera via the game settings. Besides the 3 base classes, any other classes are free to earn if you would like to learn their story, or if you do not want to wait, you can choose to purchase them outright. 

Cosmetics are completely optional and just for fun. They are the fastest thing to add to the game while the devs work on larger releases and updates to the game. We've also always had fun events with related item releases for holidays and such.

It's becoming clear that when Keen Software House say they have been working on an ""Overhaul of Multiplayer"" the name they seem to give to every update that they have in fact been working on new trailers for the game.

Keen, next time before telling people your multiplayer is ""working as intended"" please log onto your own official servers where you will be bombarded with the following messages from your own performance monitoring.

Block issues -> Too many blocks
Block issues -> Too many grids

Other issues -> Scene too complex

Multiplayer -> Poor network quality
Multiplayer -> Scene too complex

Performance -> Simulation quality

Now Keen have disabled programmable blocks on these official servers, implemented a brutal cleanup that eats genuine buildings, limited rendering range to 3km (lowest a player can set there render range is 5km) and there are no mods installed. So I'm interested in what you plan to blame the issues on?

Keen, when you can play your own official multiplayer servers for a day without having to wait for long server pauses on save, crazy rubberbanding lag and the constant issue spam from your own performance measurement system in the top right. Then tell people its fixed!

I'm sorry your experience wasn't as positive as you hoped. Some of our sim pilots, who have IRL drone experience come in with certain expectations and can feel let down by their initial flight time with the sim.

Experienced IRL pilots come in with expectations based around their personal drones and their first time with the Racer3 can be a bit jarring. The Racer3 is a heavy racing drone, that doesn't behave like consumer drones. You said you've flown heavy drones before. But I don't think you've flown a heavy drone like the Racer3. It's a beast of a drone, that weighs over 1000g with 6in props, that's built for only racing.

It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you've gotten the hang of it, you'll be tearing up the tracks with the best of them. A lot of our pilots, who've had bad first experiences like you have, once they've gotten used to how the Racer3 handles, have really come to enjoy flying it.

If I could ask you to please give the sim another shot, and maybe this time trying out one of the other drones available. Based on what you've said, I would recommend the Mifune. It's a great drone, that should be closer to what you've flown in the past. And it would be awesome to hear your thoughts on it.

I had been eyeing it for a while, but had kind of put it towards the bottom of my ""to get"" list.  I wish I had bought this sooner.  I am having such fun with this game that I can actually lose myself and suddenly six or seven hours have gone by...

The things I like about this game:

1.) The graphics and models are really great
2.) The levels are very cool and very detailed.
3.) The bow mechanics are really well done.
4.) Co-op multiplayer is a lot of fun if you can find an unlocked game (more on that later).
(EDIT): 5.) This is fantastic exercise.  I have actually started playing this with weights on my wrists.  

My complaints or things that I wish would improve (hopefully some of these will be addressed as development continues):

1.) I wish there were more playable levels other than the 3-4 that are already there.
2.) The equipment upgrades are neat, but pointless other than for cosmetics.  It would be nice if the equipment and bow upgrades actually did something to improve your character in some way --- let you take an extra axe before you die, decrease spell recharge time, increase arrow damage, give you additional skills, etc.  
3.) Leveling doesn't seem to do much other than give you an additional spell point and specify to other players how long you have been playing the game (I played a co-op with someone who was level 204 the other day).  
4.) As already mentioned, co-op is a blast provided you can find a game to play in.  Most people lock their games and I understand the reason for allowing people to lock games, so this may just be more of a complaint about the general anti-socialness of the community playing this game.  But, it's really annoying when all you see on co-op is a bunch of locked game when they all have room for 1-2 more people to join.  If you can find an open game, though, all the people playing are really fantastic, really nice, and this game is a great way to meet people.  
5.) When a multiplayer game ends, it takes FOREVER for the game to give you the option to restart the game, so if you do find a good group of people to play with, you immediately lose them at the end of the game as they go in search of other open games because it is faster to quit and rejoin multiplayer than it is to wait for someone to restart the game.  Be nice if this could be sped up A LOT.
6.) I have a problem getting my mic to work with this game.  I could easily see this one being on me and my computer, but I will mention it here since I am complaining. (EDIT): This was a HMD issue unrelated to the game that was fixed.
7.)  I wish there was an option to rotate the camera.  As I move to different towers, some of the towers are oriented such that they make me face in directions that are not as well covered by my VR sensors.  Did my best to re-setup my environment to fix this issue, but sometimes there is only so much you can do.  This would not have been an issue if there was an option to rotate the camera in the game.    
(EDIT): 8.) The devs on this game are terrible.  They are more interested in putting new features in the newer Quest version of this game than they are in actually finishing this game which has been around WAY longer.  That says these guys are more interested in a quick buck than doing a good job on what would be a solid game.  Game is great, devs not so much.  
(EDIT): 9). There is an un-godly long wait between waves, especially at the higher ones.  This has been an issue for months now (since the last ""recent"" update) with zero response or fixes from the devs.  Expect to be standing around for a bit once you get good at this game.  

Overall, great game!  Very fun, and very good exercise.  I would like to see some of the issues I mentioned be addressed/improved, but despite my complaints I think this game is solid and worth getting, even at full price.

It feels like it'll take forever and a half to unlock all of the weapon stuff, and that's actually nice as it adds a sense of progression.

As for the cons:

1. Just call the zombies ""zombies"" or ""undead"" or something. Alternatively, make enemies that aren't perfectly regular undead as seen in every videogame. As it stands, that's just confusing. I don't even remember the word NPC use to refer to the undead, it's ""snowmen"" or ""freezeboi"" or some such.

I grew up with AdventureQuest; the nostalgia value is certainly here in abundance. The way it has been revisioned from a 2D, Microsoft Paint-esque visual to a full-scale 3D MMORPG is actually my favorite part about the game. There's a lot of good things about this game despite its early access state (open beta). There's also a lot that could be improved and even a few things that need to be scrapped. 

First: as a mobile game, it's actually awesome. Plays pretty well on my Nexus 6P - battery drain is surprisingly low and there are flexible graphics settings (could be improved). Combat and gameplay is fun on mobile, not as much on PC. The cross-platform does have its conveniences, though. 

Story is pretty standard AE. It doesn't blow your mind, but the humor is entertaining for some to most. A lot of the characters, particularly the ones who have had time over the years to be fleshed out and built around the AE staff they're based on are relatable and good characters overall. Didn't get too far into AQWorlds so I can't speak as to how well they write villains these days. From what I've seen in what the story offers currently, it's not so bad. One of the first characters I actually paid attention to and liked got killed immediately and is probably the only character that will happen to.

It 100% needs a Book of Lore like what AQW has. It's hard even for veteran players to keep up on whether or not things are completed. Things are pretty ambiguous and the main story is a bit disjointed once you finish a zone. A Book of Lore would fix all of that and give the developers a guide for future content in relation to player progression and main story cohesion.

Progression needs a lot of work. Classes have no depth beyond what abilities you immediately get when switching to them. For some, it's enough, but there's definitely room for more character choice and gameplay options here. Skill trees, ability upgrades, passives, etc. What I miss from other AE games that I don't get from this one is actually progressing in your class and earning ranks, titles, and abilities. I do hope they add it even if people will gripe about more things to grind. 

On that note, gear could use some work, too. For one, a character profile or equipment page. Inventory management, especially with equipment, is messy. It needs a page that shows each slot and any equipped cosmetic. Would be nice if that all didn't take up inventory space, too. 

Gear stats need more depth and relevance. I'd like personal player stats we can choose to upgrade like classic AQ. But equipment just providing basic Attack, Armor, Crit, Haste, Evasion, etc. is just boring. I get that they want people to just switch between classes at their discretion (it's a fine idea if implemented well) but this way is just too simple and takes away from player choice and meaningful gear grinding (if that's a thing).

That goes into my last major critique which is the UI. On PC, some of the elements have weird scaling. On mobile, screen space is hard to manage in any game, but this one could use some work. The inventory is mostly a big mess and it would be nice if the chat window and health bar were located somewhere else, although I can understand how frustrating it must be. If any developers read this, I'd suggest having some UI options available for people as every mobile device is different. 

AQ3D's Kickstarter page nailed the main point: it's a game that has a lot of potential. It's not even close to living up to it, though that's not to say it's a bad game, just that it has so much room to grow. In a market completely oversaturated with copy-pasted Asian MMORPGs, especially on mobile, this could be the game that topples it all and I hope it is. 

I'd recommend personally if only because I've actually been really enjoying my time with it on my phone. I'm really excited to see what they add later on, especially if they took the time to gather feedback and update classes according to it. If you didn't grow up with AE, they are the type of developers to literally put themselves into their games (I've met their NPCs and actual characters dozens of times in-game), be transparent about their plans and shortcomings, and keep pushing out content.

They seem to be spread a bit thin with how many games they have - it would be a tough call to pull the plug on older games, but I understand they're focusing heavily on AQ3D anyway. It's certainly far from a perfect game, even a great game, but it's a great time-killer on mobile and is like any AE game very social. 

Some of the negative reviews I've seen aren't totally fair. I'd just check it out on your phone if it seems interesting to you and make up your own mind, like I did. If you grew up with AQ, definitely try it out.

I'll recommend this even in its rough, incomplete stage because while it is fun and succeeds in some ways, it has a long way to go and every bit of feedback helps AE and I know they factor it all in.",1510383874,1510384242,True,0,0,0.0,0,False,False,True,False,,,,429790

This game is basicaly a one man endeavor, it is a 2d platformer with GREAT graphics. No, really, this guy must have had a lot of work implementing all the lighting effects that are top notch! Animations, sound and music are good. It is a tad short and some items and mechanics are not fully needed/fleshed out, but it is forgivable, because it is hard to cut things out. The exploration is a little hard, boss fights are nice.

The launch was a little shaky, with some bug that are being squashed daily. I found some, but nothing major. If there is one thing that I have to say that really annoyed me is that it uses frame skipping, and it doesn't work very well. I think this might be a little hard to implement in game maker, but this should be fixed. Even if at 95% of the game my graphics card can run it smoothly at 60fps, some scenes droped to a crawl, and I had to change the config midgame, since auto just seems to lock my gig at 30fps without any need.

So, I highly recommend the game!

You cannot play this game without registering for a separate ""Frontier Support"" account. 

It is a pain to deal with.

I tried this game a year ago for 16min and gave up since the Thrustmaster HOTAS wasn't working well with my then Windows 7.  

Fast Forward to 2020, trying to re-install to see if the Thrustmaster works better with Windows 10, but somehow FRONTIER SUPPORT does not recognize my game/account as legitimate, cannot log-in after jumping through the hoops of email verification, which somehow you need to do twice : first two authenticate the email, then to get a code.    

friction
too-many steps
not working

I don't have the time or energy to spend hours on support for a $8 game, but I decided to test the water and check their Customer Support page :

""RESPONSE TIME: UP TO 7 DAYS.
We are experiencing higher than normal ticket volumes, and may not have capacity to answer queries within seven days. Please be assured, any tickets sent will be addressed in the shortest time possible.""

Hard pass

don't make it so full of friction to play your game
don't force people to log-in into a separate system to play your game on Steam

hint : if you want fewer customer support tickets, put fewer hurdles in your customer's journey.

congrats for having swindled this user out of a few bucks.

double checking the developer name to make a mental note to not be fooled again : Frontier Development.

Edit : now this cancer of a game (game itself might be great, heard good things, but the process is terrible) displays errors as I try to uninstall it, and stays RUNNING even as I restart Steam, impossible to get rid of it, and it tallies that as ""Game played"".   my ""in-game"" time went from 16min to 50 minutes just trying to get rid of the damn thing, oh dear.

Still tedious, grindy and boring, but now with added bugs and more half-finished features...
Avoid like the plague if you're new...

Poor mission design.  Dull, lifeless planets.  Most content stuck behind needing a capital ship and/or a wing, but be prepared to grind for hours before being able to afford one.
The flight model is good and if you like flight sims and space sims then you will enjoy just plodding around space truckin' and ferrying passengers, but if you like excitement and combat (since you can only really have fun doing this after hours and hours of grinding), find something else to scratch that itch.  Also, most definitely not worth the full price seeing as you need the season pass/DLC to have anything to do in this game.
Shame really.  Frontier and Egosoft should team up and make us a space sim does it all.

Thanks very much for providing a link to the support page.  Appreciate that you guys still actively scan the reviews and offer support.

Now this is gunna be a long one so a short TLDR; Don't get this untill it is complete if at all, its full of abandoned ideas, bugs and the Devs don't seem to know what the end result is themselves

I am Mouse, otherwise known as Miz and at one point was a Mod for the team in their discord, I spoke with individual devs quite a bit and had a lot of faith of the team to really knock this out of the park

Along with an exodus of other mods I am now banned from the discord for daring to have worries about the development of the game and voicing them (in DM's might I add) and was threatened to have my DM transcript with the Project lead posted if i made this negative review, hence why I held off on making this review untill a couple months later.

So lets talk about the game shall we?

At its base this is a simple enough premise, base building, unit production, kill zombies.
The core is certainly there and there's an enjoyable enough loop to give you a few hours of fun, for the price it is its reasonable, if we got for $ = 1 hour of fun ratio.... I doubt most people will get that however, not in its current form, theres only 1 map for the ""main"" game mode and the additional ""Hoard"" really is just more of the same.
My own hours are largely breaking and bug reporting. 
As always milage may vary

So whats wrong?

Now the main problems with the game are still the same as when i picked it up way back when, critical game breaking bugs, path-finding AI that couldn't find its way out of an unlocked room and the general feeling that the game isnt quite sure of what it wants to be.
Every run I had of the game has been met with the same issues, units that dont follow orders, zombies that spawn from nowhere and the invincible (by design) antagonist just.... breaking, not moving and by extension the zombies becoming pushovers. These problems were so persistent I found myself just telling people in the discord, who just bought the game that it was ""Just Early access jank"" but that was over a year ago, at what point do longstanding bugs be so baked in that being EA no longer excuse the fact they have not been fixed in so long?

The game also suffers from a severe identity problem, what started as a squad based game has become an open world game, sorta, its not /really/ open world and moeso, just, big map. Now they say that they plan on adding side missions to complete and a campaign but, thats still not open world, it just has 1 kinda big map, thats all and the performance on it is, frankly, awful to its counterparts.

Now at one point I had faith the team would deliver on a lot of its promises, they listened to what was being asked and could be found in the community discussing suggestions, good and bad, on feasibility and problems. Critical bugs were often fixed within the day, I saw community suggested units being added and new enemy types, it felt like progress was good and the team and community were on the similar rails.
Of late however this has changed drastically.

Behind the scenes
A lot seems to be hidden, features picked up and left halfway, abandoned features half in the game and requests for us moderators to stop talking about features because they are not being worked on.
Yeah, no announcement, just please stop talking about it

So lets start at the beginning, features.
Now while there is a roadmap for this game, this has been changed multiple times as the team couldnt keep up, COOP that was supposed to be added last year, that was a Patreon pledge that people paid for (now removed) was pushed back and back each time with a new promised date untill eventually a TBA was given. 
The zerg-like zombie Creep that was trailed, broke a few things then silently dropped. 
The ability for zombies to swim, hinted at so many times with exact details still unclear, then talked about no more
Zombies to climb buildings to skirt the cheese of roof camping, Gifs shown to see this in motion then... silently dropped
Factions, told they were ""being worked on"" despite them running on an old version of the game for months and months, for the mods to be told ""Yeah we aint working on these right now please stop talking about it"" and.... silently dropped.
A vehicle damage system, allowing drivers and pilots to be killed and vehicles to be recrewed, halfway completed then nothing.
The Evac system, its in, with a lot of old placeholders, in a strange limbo state

Now while its easy to say its a small team on public funding, ie they can only work on it when people buy the game, something i said for a long time myself, I have to look at what the team /has/ been working on.

A 1st person mode that was met with either ""eh"" or ""we don't want this"" that was worked on anyway, then dropped in exchange for a 3rd person anyway, that still nobody had asked for nor was on the roadmap.
Multiple redesigns of CERC units, just basic vanity while game breaking bugs still existed, also note these are going to get done /again/ because of the fact many of the civilian models are just assets and only the assault is actually a finished mesh
Map re-design after map redesign with more and more added just lagging the game more, while they couldnt get stable framerates on what they did have
Spin off books and Skins, now the skins I* think are fine, they asked the community what they wanted and they needed the funding, nothing wrong with these well aware of the minimal work required, but there are now more books than game modes, nor can i imagine they are cheap to make, also telling people to read a book if they want the game's story is uhhh, wild.
More game revamps than I can count, it really has had so many faces and i cannot tell you what its going to look like at the end

Which really is the crux of the problem, what actually is Cepheus Protocol (dont shorten that) trying to be? I once asked Dark this and got effectely they want to be be freeform, the ability to tackle any problem any way, to not be ""gimicky."" I respect that, but right now it has nothing at all, in fact its only unique feature is the Music and fact theres not really any base building RTS zombie games out there. 

After many months of hearing little to nothing, watching features be silently dropped i reached out to a team member I'd had prior discussions with about the game, wondering if they had ever considered gettting a community manger. A harmless question considering I'd been asked it myself a few times, I'd even had a few people volunteer to do the job part time for the guys and, as I was well trusted it seemed, they asked through me.
We had a short talk about the current state of the game  where we both agreed too many systems were half or ""70% implimented"" which lead to it feeling ""all over the place"" and as I was on the other side of the planet, I went to sleep.

I woke up to find myself removed as a moderator the the Lead dev, Dark, telling me he wouldnt have people with no faith in the project as a moderator (Also bare in mind I had been vocally critical of the game for around a year, before i was a of, my honesty is exactly why I was listened to) which sets a dangerous precedent of ""yes men"" in the discord. Also demanding that any criticism be levelled solely at him, as if discussing the game with other team members was complete taboo unless it was positive praise. 
After a back and forth on why I'd spoke to someone else, primarily Dark's self confessed inability to read everything (Everyone pings dark after all) I was banned completely from the discord, this within the same week 2 other mods were too.

So yes, I do not reccoemnd a game with 2 year old bugs, abandonded features and a Lead Dev unable to have any discussion unless positive or risk banning.
I'm sure there will be a comment left on this post, but I'll be leaving them disabled as I cba to give anymore time to this game or devs

As you mentioned we are a small team(5 devs) and we are doing the best we can with the limited resources available to us.  You also fail to highlight the successes we've had and only relegate us to the failures we've had.  I would invite anyone reading this review to check out our roadmap and research our news post for how much the game has developed/improved. Game design is iterative and we acknowledge our failures and learn from them as noted by earmarking a lot of time to audit the project further in the upcoming CERC/Doctrines roadmap card and submitting that audit to our community to add anything we missed to further refine and push the core game.

As you stated when we discussed this in DM's you professed to me that you can basically say whatever you want by stating  ""Because im autistic as S%%@."" That you can basically talk to myself or other developers however you'd like. Being a Moderator means you are an ambassador for the Discord/Community in question which means you have some amount of professionalism in how you conduct yourself.

As for the topic of the Moderations that did leave they were caught abusing their power, bragging to normal members and tagging developers after multiple warnings to stop for non-emergences.  

Why would we want Moderators to keep mentioning features that we weren't even sure we could fully implement and were waiting for Epic to implement features to better support them in the future. I addressed this multiple times to you on Discord, on AmA's on Youtube and on public channels that the Infection Growth, Infected climbing and Swimming were being delayed because rolling them out to the larger map would require more engine support and more resources which was earmarked and stated publicly to be broken up and tackled over the AI cards on the roadmap.... 

I looked and you never submitted any bug reports/save files. We can only fix the issues that users report and work with us on should it be a complex issue. Anyone researching the project can search our forums/discord and collaborate this and how we actively help and talk to everyone that posts. 

How you choose to conduct yourself is everything, This entire conversation  would have been completely different had you asked for a call/DMed me directly instead of  petitioning my developers behind my back and then they approaching me on how they felt uncomfortable on how you were talking about the project to them.  On numerous times i have sat in calls and on the public Discord talking to fans for hours hearing the bad and good watching them play taking notes and figuring out what we can do and what we can't to earmark for the future!

 Kenshi took 10 years, Project Zomboid +5?. We are working every day  to bring this game home and perfectly simulate a viral/zombie outbreak. And do remember we are in our 3rd year and have accomplished a lot! Do we have things to work on absolutely and we will continue to work on the game and with our community till the game is a gem!

So I've replayed it to see how much it actually changed, and how much of what I mentioned has actually been adressed.
Therefore, the following is an edited version from the original review, for the original review, please go to http://pastebin.com/xJqfjmhX or ask me directly for a copy. The review shown here is from 18 November, almost an exact two months after the first.

Planetbase is a great, if simple concept for a game. Yet flawed in its execution and sadly nowhere near fullfilling its potential.

While it has come a bit since release, it is still full of frustrating moments and flaws, sadly this taints what is otherwise an interesting game that looks fairly good and runs great even on subpar hardware.
Out of the flaws that were fixed, the most game-breaking were the first to go, with the nutrition system being slightly more forgiving through boosting how much basic meals your colonists can eat, and the AI being a bit more open to actually trying to do something that will lead to the colonists' survival, it still has issues.
You are still encouraged to not diversify your food supply, and colonists are still very robot-like in their methods. They have a habit of just standing around at random in your base, but at the least they seem to be willing to survive.
Sadly, They have any idea of prioritisation (And there are only VERY basic options to give them a priority, with only one button to prioritise a new construction over other constructions since my original review at release). Prioritising your workshops does just about nothing, as far as resources are concerned. You may have prioritised the spares factory so you can repair that solar panel that keeps the lights on, but your colonists prefer to put your materials into the bar construction that you have not prioritised, but also dont want to completely stop since there has already been a fair amount of resources hauled out there. Prioritisation remains an issue, as well as the limit as to your controls over what actually has the limited prioritisation you have access to - If there's a semiconductor foundry in the same room as your spares production, that will get the same priority as your spares if you prioritise the spares.

The second big flaw is in the interface and controls. You are very limited in how you can control the game, there are near no prioritisation buttons, you can not pause the game except by going to the menu, and there do not appear to be any graphics settings of note(Only 'ultra' 'high' 'medium' 'low', anti-aliasing and a resolution? Seriously?). There are no reliable ways to control or guide colonists, nor any way to prioritise for example your doctor making a medkit to treat the injured over hauling some vegetables to the trader. Nor can you tell when someone has just started work or when they're going to stop working. In general, there just is no structure to the base. Your crew just does what they feel like with no regard for the consequences while you have no way to tell them what to do.

The base itself is empty, and yet there is not enough room. Every single dome needs a long corridor that goes only from it to one other part of your base. There is no way to split from a corridor, and corridors need to have a minimum length, thus making sure you have long travel times no matter how you build. This of course means very little work gets done when you expand, with less and less getting done the more you build. Colonists do not interact with eachother either, and a majority of your base will be empty space where nothing fits or can be placed.

The nutrition system is still much the same, and works by loading a specific combination(One of multiple) into the meal maker machine to create nutritious meals. You give them 3 kinds of meat and 6 different kinds of vegetables? Doesn't matter. The game makes every kind of food ingredient into a generic 'basic meal' unless your unthinking colonists just happen to load the right combination of ingredients into the food making machine to make a nutritious meal. I've personally witnessed one food maker filled up with beef and only beef, and right next to it one filled up with only maize. Those two could have made burgers, nutritious delicious burgers, but instead I could do nothing but watch as the game turned them into generic 'basic meals'. A sad thing to see, for sure. But luckily no longer something that breaks your base as they can now hold out long enough for random chance to put together items well enough for a nutritious meal.
The problem remains though, with six slots in the meal maker, and most plants you grow growing in twos or threes you will not be able to make the meals consisting of three different ingredients unless you get very lucky.

This game needs a fair amount of work before I would consider it viable, and as much as I was looking foreward to it and was hoping to just relax, sit back and build myself a base, I found myself unable to do anything except fast foreward as my base stagnated and nothing got done. It's a good idea, and a good base for a game. But with the interface, options menu, and the AI as it is, I would not be able to recommend it.",1445222607,1447881212,False,453,29,0.8115017414093016,31,True,False,False,False,,1453725376.0,"[h1]Out of date review[/h1]

With regards to other cosmetics, it's just the beginning! We've got a ton more stuff in the pipeline :). What would you like to see for Ashani?

I'm also excited to share the recent steps we've made to address the F2P model.
 
- We now credit ALL players 1100 spectra when they join, so you can buy any character you want right off the bat. We also gave this to all existing players, so if you haven't spent yours yet, it's ready for you now.

- You can now try out ANY character in training mode. This was a key request from players who wanted to try out characters before picking one up.

In addition to the above, we're working on several new features to make the game fun and engaging right from the get go. This includes granting a character much earlier and giving more ways to earn spectra. We expect those to start coming online soon.

This is just the start. We entered Early Access so that we can work directly with you to make Icons ready for the world. You can read about the roadmap here:

Either optimization or lots of bug fixes. I joined the testing for the final update and knew this game was gonna work smooth once it got full released.

Here i am again back and playing the full release and can't say anything else than that i am in love with the game, you can see they have taken inspiration a little bit from the s.t.a.l.k.e.r games. That means the game is not only a good substitute to play while waiting for s.t.a.l.k.e.r 2 to come out, the game are also  just super enjoyable to spend time in since the whole base manage part and also have to manage so the characters you take in to your base wanna stay there. You don't need to play the stalker games to enjoy this, chernobylite will drag you in to a very interesting story while exploring for stuff.

What i do like with the game also is that it doesent hold your hands when you try find more clues about your wife, you have to explore to find information about her.

Atmosphere is amazing and you will most of the time have this creepy feeling while scavanging through buildings for resources.

I will not do a 1-10 thingy, i talk from own experience when i have played it and i know a review will not really tell people much more than what i think about the game, in the end if you are interested in the game. Buy it and give it a try, in my own opinion the game is worth every penny.

I'm not sure on their decision to making a game in this day and age for a 320x200 CRT screen though, and have to upscale it on you screen. Is it just trying to capture the look of old games for old times sake?
I assume the art would have been drawn at higher resolution to start with, why not keep it like that instead of downgrading it into pixels? The only reason games use to look like that was because that's all they were capable of.

OLD REVIEW(before early access ended):

Great idea. Really is. I really want this game to be good, but it needs too many things to be fixed as of this moment. Not just bugs, but fundamental game aspects. I played the demo last year and since then it has improved tremendously, but there are still really wonky aspects of the game. Such as the sound is quiet and loud at the same time at random. There is no good way to tell what is getting attacked especially if you are on the opposite of the surface/cave. 

It would be cool if the survival gamemode had goals? Like the starcraft mode Left 2 Die. It isn't much, but it's something to keep you going. Rather than senseless onslaught of buggy path finding enemies. 

Overall the game has promise and i love seeing an indie RTS with genre pushing mechanics. I have mixed feelings on the game as of now, but hopefully it improves drastically in time.",1624702736,1634793989,False,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,,,977650

Just recommended or not recommended.

I have completely rewritten the review so if some of the people in the comments section don't make sense this may be why.

Since I had a negative experience with the devs, I will leave the review as not recommended.  I will cover this below.

Wild Terra as it stands right now is an early access title.  It has been getting regular updates, usually small ones sprinkled with larger ones here and there.  The title has come a long way in the last 6 or so months before it hit Steam just in terms of character movement which has helped immensely.

I have only played on a PvE server so cannot vouch for the play on a PvP server.  The game is slow paced which I like.  I can sit back and relax while playing.  Game play consists of running around the map collecting resources for building up your dominion (what the game calls your base of operations).  Once you have your dominion built then you can work on expanding it and/or collecting resources to make into useful items needed for the extensive amount of recipes found in the game.  

While wandering the map you can find godsends, which come in the for of decomposed adventurers or crashed wagons.  Inside the godsends you can find items as well as recipe fragments.  The recipes you cannot make from the beginning of the game can be found in these godsends.  Each recipe requires a certain amount of fragments to be found before you can create that item.  From what I can tell it can take from 1 to I believe 4 or 5 fragments to unlock specific recipes.  It seems that once you do unlock a recipe that some recipes have a gold recipe that can be unlocked.  The crafting is deep in the game.

The Map:  This is the biggest issue I have with the game.  Everything is player driven (which isn't a bad thing).  There are no NPC cities or towns.  Everything on the map is one flat surface with trees, water, wild life, and resource nodes.  There is absolutely nothing that stands out that you could reference as to where you are in the world.  Once you have a dominion, you get a marker on the edge of the screen that you can use to get back, but that's it.

Player base:  This is where the game shines for the most part.  Most people in the global chat are very helpful and willing to help people out with questions and issues they have.  Some people leave a chest or storage outside for others to come along and rummage through for anything they may need.  During the Christmas event (before the devs lowered the cost) the stockings were hard to make because they needed a loom which unlocks from recipe fragments (found in godsends) and most weren't able to  make them.  One good person on the server would make the items you needed if you brought them the resources.

The devs:  I was wrongly banned from the Steam forums and it took a week before they realized I was wrongly banned and unbanned me.  The devs seem to just willingly ban anyone from their forums that speak bad about the game or the cash shop or in my case ban the wrong guy.  Instead of making a sticky at the top of the forums that lists exactly what is in the cash shop and opening it to discussion.  I feel everyone that is on the fence about the game has a right to know as much information on the game before they make a purchase.  So that brings up the next part.....

Cash Shop:  Once in the game, you can bring up the cash shop.  Inside you will find titles you can bestow on your character along the lines of Duke and Knight and a handful of others.  If you want a mount, you can pick from horses, deer, wolves, and bears.  If you want to dip into their premium  offering you can get a bonus for your character for a period of time based on how much you wish to spend.  I tried to see what the time length was for this review but the cash shop wouldn't come up for me at time of writing this review.  The premium is described (I wrote this down earlier when I was replying to someone) as:  Doubles chances to get rare items, gathering, building, and crafting speed.  As a PvE player this doesn't bother me in the least.  I don't care what the other guy is getting or what he is doing.  In a PvP setting I can see this as being an issue as the other guy is now pulling out double resources on some of the harder to find resource nodes in the world.  If the rare drop is (no clue what the actual drop rate is) 10% then the premium player is getting 20%.  

Due to how the premium is worded this is how I see it as working.  It could be double to getting rare items and an increase to gathering, building and crafting.  Even though an increase in rares can still be an advantage depending on the drop rate imposed in the game.

Is the game bad?  No and I feel I more than received my monies worth during my past and most likely future game play.  As an early access title the content is limited despite the large amount of items you can craft.  This is an issue that plagues many early access titles and is the bane of the whole ea system in general except for a few exclusions.

I do recommend Wild as the game itself, but you must realize what the game is and what it isn't.  It is not an action packed game full of dazzling sword play and fireballs whizzing inches from your face.  In fact there is no magic to speak of.

I do not recommend Wild Terra based on the actions of the developers.  They seem like they care about the game and are definitely actively working on it, but deleting posts in the Steam forums and banning is definitely not the way to go and sends off bad vibes to current customers and prospective customers.  They need to take the good with the bad, embrace it and use that feedback to allow the game to flourish. 

Verdict: Neutral.  If what you have read appeals to you and you can get past the developers then you can find a nice little time sink here.  If you're like me and try to answer questions for other people in the forums and just be an all around nice guy, then beware that you should probably not talk about the cash shop in any form at least until the devs smarten up and just embrace the contents they provide in the shop and not try to hide them.",1483310096,1484075182,False,132,3,0.8751033544540405,39,False,False,True,False,,1483944151.0,"Hello.

Text version of the video review below

After playing this game for quite some time I can fully recommend it. In a nutshell ACS is one of the deepest and richest Sandbox RPG games I've encountered so far. It has a knack towards base building but it's completely different to titles like Rimworld. It shares a similar base design, but ACS leans way heavier towards character development, world exploration and fantasy story telling.

Pros about this game are it's insane depth, a very cuddly and wholesome graphics style which also has a pretty high quality standard. On top of that it's moddable and therefore there's no ceiling to the content of the game. Everything makes sense, is very well fleshed out and offers hours and hours of interesting content if you are into Eastern Fantasy.

The Cons are: Steep learning curve as hell, a pretty clunky UI which is at times mildly infuriating and a translation which leads to misunderstandings and confusions at times. The third part is something I am pretty sure will be gone in a few months/years. Don't get me wrong, the translation is solid, but it's noticeable that there still needs work to be done.
The Learning curve is what I consider the heaviest Downside of the game. You really gotta dig deep into the game to actually enjoy it. But that's also a Pro - if you dislike shallow or too easy games in general

My summary: Absolute recommendation! 
Albeit it's quirks the game is one of the deepest and richest experiences I've had in 2020 and I don't think the devs will stop here. The game is moddable (translation work from Chinese takes some time though) so we are sure gonna see a lot more stuff in the coming years. 
If you have doubts - check out a few gameplay videos and decide for yourself if the gamestyle scratches your itch, cause the game sure is quite eccentric. But if you get past it's hard shell, it's an adorable simulator which gives you so much freedom of design and choices - it's awesome!",1609579641,1609579641,True,50,3,0.7934817671775817,0,True,False,False,False,,,,955900

They've taken a complex trading sim series and made it a dull city builder series, where even the city building aspect is about as deep as a puddle.

The gameplay that is there is relatively well polished for the most part, but all of it leaves me wanting more.

I want more city building, bigger plots, more buildings, something more.

I want more complex trading. Automation can cut down on tedium, but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. Setting it up still has a great deal of tedium, then you click go and never both to manage it again. 

Combat is turned based on a grid... and frankly, terribly boring. I really don't know what they were thinking. 

There are missions and treasure maps, and again, they're shallow without much depth in either system.

Fame and Fame Points and simple and allow you to unlock items on a Fame tree that are locked because... why? I'm not sure why I have to be famous to make a rope factory. Can anyone explain what fame has to do with rope factories? I get it when it comes to some of the larger vessels, but many of the buildings are just artificial gates to slow down your progress.

I haven't played a ton of the game, no, but until they manage to flesh out the game more I don't think I'll be playing it again.

Regarding the difficulty: Have you tried using higher difficulty settings in free play?
Especially with regional resources changed from „even distribution“ to „Regional distribution“ and trade routes from „with automation“ to „without automation“ make the game far more challenging and fun for experienced players. By default, the game settings are suited for beginners.

Please rest assured that the other topics you’ve raised will be discussed and taken into consideration for further improvements to the game.

Just like in previous games like ""Railway Empire"", we plan to work with the community for improvements and long-term support.

Unfortunately,  I can't get a refund because I waited too long for a response on the support forum and it was no longer eligible for a refund.

Apparently it works well with occulus.  But simply does not work on WMR,  and by the developers post responses to others in the past, it sounds like they didn't have a WMR headset to test it,  so they should never, ever have indicated it was WMR compatible.

So if you have an occulus, it might be worth trying.   If not,  you are out of luck, and the developer doesn't appear keen on fixing the problems for WMR users.

So I have to give it a big old thumbs down.   I was scammed.   Would never have bought it if they were honest about WMR support.

This is their only commercial release to date but they did do two games for Indie Speed Run 2013 called Like a Raisin in the Sun and Salt. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where all the humans are gone and you play a robot named Horatio Nullbuilt.  You have a broken down ship that you live in and another robot breaks in shoots you and steals your power core. Now you are on a mission to get it back.

Gameplay:
	It plays just like a typical point & click adventure game. Finding objects to use and figure out puzzles to progress further in the game. Puzzles were a little challenging for me but were fun to figure out. They require some logic and can have multiple ways to figure them out. Choices you make in the game can change things later in the game. If you’ve played other adventure games then you’ll have no trouble playing this.

Story:
	It kept me interested and curious to dig deeper. It all starts out over a power core but there’s a deeper secret you can uncover if you make the right choices in the game. Great supporting cast which brought some comedy to the game. I really enjoyed the banter from Crispin your little sidekick throughout the game. There’s also seven different endings to the story if you care to see them all.

Visuals & Sound:
	It has retro style graphics with some great looking hand drawn rooms. They did a great job of showing you a dark and grim world. An easy to use interface, and great voice acting. You can also change it to text only if you are one who just wants to read it all.

Overall:
	Primordia was a fun and enjoyable game. The story was a little slow in the beginning but picks up a little ways in. I laughed at times and even felt a little sad at times.

* is not GDPR / BDSG (the latter relevant in Germany) compliant for a number of reasons.

I did also send my findings to German Data Protection Authorities - and due to the malicious behavior of the Gaijin tool itself, also to German BSI. I also filed the case against Steam - since Steam does obviously support this type of business practices.

Since this Gaijin behavior is the same for WarThunder and other products, I can only urge others to follow my example and make a short notice to their authorities to end such things - see EA some years ago, we - the games - can make the producers of such game change. And it is not as if the game is for free, paying with your data - not the PC data but as it looks like, way more, isn't for free at all.

Last and least - and that's the flabbergast news - since my firewall stopped the P2P traffic instantly, the updater obviously is able to handle data transfer via standard HTTP.

Our company diligently sets and updates policies regarding the safe handling of user data, as described in our Privacy Policy https://crossout.net/en/support/privacypolicy/#/ , and if there are any additional questions – we welcome them.
In the Privacy Policy  https://crossout.net/en/support/privacypolicy/#/ we describe all the data we get from players to ensure the correct running of the game: «2.2.3. Details about your device (such as operating system, browser type and language, manufacturer, model, screen resolution, and interface language);»
Aside from this a player can send their game data to the tech support.  The launcher provides a tool to create a set of relevant data consisting of dxdiag, driverquery, tasklist, ipconfig and launcher/ game logs to make the interactions with the tech support easier if some issue arises, but it doesn’t send any data, it merely assembles a data package which the player can send to the tech support if he or she wishes to do so. The tool operates only with the game-relevant data and cannot and doesn’t touch anything else stored on your computer.
If you do not wish to use Crossout, once you uninstall it no data will be collected from your device, of course.  While uninstalling, Steam runs the launcher to delete the game. Then Steam deletes the launcher.  Log files might remain in case the player decides to reinstall the game, as is the case for many other games – it’s the industry standard practice, but you can delete them manually, then no traces will remain.
Speaking of the double nature of the download protocols usage: P2P is faster, so it’s a primary source, but it it is not available, the launcher falls back to downloading from content delivery network servers, it’s a rather standard practice for games, and it doesn’t endanger the data security.
Thank you for the feedback, I hope I alleviated the concerns you have voiced. Have a good day!

I do not know if developers are going to fix what I consider shortcomings, and if they are not, then I'm not recommending the game altogether.

When you start a new game for the first time you are presented with 3 difficulty choices. Two of them are locked at this stage, so you only can choose the easiest. (Very minor gripe: why the heck to give a choice when there is no choice?)

When you are playing the game there are 10 ""milestones"", certain conditions during the game that are used to measure your progress. They could be ""reach 500 power"" or ""reach 100 colonists"" or sopmething else. In my first and only game (that took 17 hours across three sessions) I got 9/10. The last one ""reach 300 colonists"" was not possible for me to achieve because I ran out of space for colony buildings, and here is my problem number 1.

When you start a new game, you ""choose"" a pinpoint on the planet where you land. The interface for choosing it is abysmal	. You cannot rotate the planet with keyboard and you cannot zoom in or out. Mouse speed when rotating is about of a dying snail. I honestly cannot understand why they included this game element, it's awkward and pointless. In zoomed out state you do not see what landscape is like so you are just choosing at random. And here is where the real problem starts. I happened to land in a relatively small area surrounded by mountains from 3 sides, and the 4th side was the edge of the map (which is also bizarre, because I mean they just allowed me to rotate the freaking planet, I know that it's a sphere and I know that it does not have an edge). When I started the game I did not realize that there would not be enough space for me to fully develop, and that the game gives you a zilch ways of crossing the mountains. The ""edge"" is also not obvious. At a certain point you can no longer build in that direction, no line in the sand, perfectly level surface, it just does not let you place a building as if you are trying to place it on to  another building or on a mountain. Frustrated, you are trying again and again, until you realize that you are not supposed to build on the other side of an invisible wall. Anyway, after 17 hours of play it is a surprise that you cannot actually finish the level.

That was problem number 1. Note, that the game is probably meant to be open ended, so I'm not sure if it would properly ""finish"" even if I got 10/10. So how they say, the pleasure is the journey, not the destination. (Edit: the game does not have a win condition. You have a hard limit of 200 buildings and 500 colonists)

Here is problem number 2. Some sim games give you an info panels about your minions (in this case colonists) and this one is no different. What is different from some of the games I played before, is that the info panel usually have a button to find the minion or to follow it. Not in this game. You click a colonist, you look at the panel and when you are done this colonist already wondered away and with a big base you cannot find her any longer, because she looks exactly like anyone else. By the way if the person departs (visitor) the info panel does not reflect this and displays the last known data. Now, you might be thinking, but do you actually *need* to look at the colonist information? I'll be honest with you I wondered the same. You see, I'd be happy if the game was built so that this information is of no use and can be totally hidden. I'd also be happy if it was there and easy to use. But currently if you'd like to investigate why your colonists are dying for no obvious reason you really can't. First of all, ""a colonist has died"" notification when clicked does NOT show you the colonists or her info pane. It just jumps somewhere on the map. Presumably, this is the place where the colonist died. There is no body or any indication of what happened though. So you reload a recent save if you were lucky to have one, and you are trying to find that person that is going to die. But since the game does not have a colonists list, or colonists search, you cannot really find this person, no way. If by some crazy accident you managed to find her and select her and look at her info panel... well I did not manage that.

Here is problem number 3. As game flows you get event notifications in the bottom left corner. You left click to follow them, you right click to dismiss them. If you are not fast enough they are gone. If these where landing permissions and you missed it, well sucks to be you, you just lost these coins you otherwise could have earned, better luck next time. If there was two similar events about different objects the game group them up and excludes any specific information. So if two building were completed or two people died, you won't be informed what these building where or what theses people died from. Why is there no log, that one could browse at leisure? Btw, sometimes but not always, even if just *one* person dies the game does not tell you why. ""Well he died. Whatever.""

So the above sums up to the following. I wish I did not need the log, I wish I did not need to track individual colonists, but I do. And here is why. When my colony was developed with about 100 colonists and 30 bots, I had all my production lines up. I did not have absence of any particular resource. In particular, there was enough food. Still a colonists died ""from starvation"". Then another one, then another. Soon there was enough dead that there was not enough people to for the hydroponics, so the food supply plummeted and everyone died because now there was really no food. This happens, and the game gives you no way to find out what went wrong. You are simply left in the dark. This leads me on to...

Problem number 4. This game does not support any corrective actions. If you ran out of an important resource (any important resource) there is no way to recover. (If you have plenty of other resources and lucky timing a trader flies by you might be able to salvage the situation, but from my about a dozen reloads it did not happen once). The only thing you can do is to reload your previous save and make sure that this resource does not run out. I'm not sure, maybe it's a genre staple? If it is I do not like it, I feel that there should be an in-game way to correct a mistake without the need to reload.

Problem number 5. There seems to be a limited number of save slots and the saves are called save1, save2 and save3. I'm serious, that's what they are called and you cannot change these. (I understand that this is probably so that they can port to a mobile device easily, but it's just an explanation, not a good excuse)

Problem number 6. So remember I told you that there is no way to find out what happened when something goes wrong? Well what the game wants you to do is to use built in resource graphs to figure out what dynamic led up to the current situation. The only problem is that there are bazillion of different resources and a single graphs screen. You have an icon per resource that you switch on an off to show the line on the graph or not. This is so bloody inconvenient. Because they did not have enough colours, half of the colours are the same so you cannot tell on the graph one line from another, and there is no legend. Also certain types of resources mean something to some people like me in combinations. So for example I want often to see raw ore and metal produced from it. And then I want to see starch and bioplastic produced from it, and also vegetables, because they same as start come out from the hydroponic pods. And in order to switch from one view from another I need to unclick all the old resources one by one and then click all the new ones one by one, what a nuisance!

This game could be good. Currently it is not. The worst thing, that most of the problems are only noticeable only when you are well in the game, and not immediately.",1445984270,1446403530,False,15,0,0.5317096710205078,1,True,False,False,False,,1448933340.0,"Hello there!

The net code has always been a topic of debate and from what it looks like it was never remade, just added onto. I say this because the game itself ran better and had a stable multiplayer connection before the planet update. I would even say the planet system should be remade entirely, since there's no water system in the game at all. Not to mention the Mobs were handled poorly. Its very unlikely that these issues will be solved in the future.

I have a soft spot in my heart for dystopian/post-apocalyptic/cyberpunk/steampunk settings and stories so this game quickly became a favorite of mine. Great writing with quirky humor, fun characters, and a memorable world all made the experience thought provoking and enjoyable.

We are really sorry about your disappointment in the game. We believe the dev team has been quite forward in detailing both the strengths and weaknesses of CMO in the land combat domain, as one of the pre-release dev diaries was dedicated to this domain: https://www.warfaresims.com/?p=4982

As you can see, that article goes into considerable depth into the improvements over CMANO, the new abilities as well as the limitations that still prevent the game from being compared to land-centric titles.

If you choose to stay with the game notwithstanding your negative initial impression, we welcome your feedback on the specific items that can be improved on ground ops, as well as any other improvement on both the simulation and game-playing experience, on the dedicated suggestions poll on the MG forum: https://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=4709794 . We want this leg of joint ops to be improved in its modelling as much as you do, so there is a good chance that your priorities on this will match ours.

If OTOH you have decided to put the game away (or refund it) because of the current limitations, we are again sorry for your disappointment and do hope that you keep an eye out for the next major iteration in the Command lineage, which is more than likely to feature even more improvements in this aspect.

to start, as soon as you get into the first level, a screen with simple control directions pops up. you read it for about 10 seconds and then you want it to go away so you can start, it does say 'press h to quit'. this is the best advice an evil sinner dev can give. don't stop at pressing the 'h' key. turn off your computer, go outside, or just do anything short of suicide(that is a sin and the devil gets your soul) to avoid playing this. it turned out that after 30 seconds of anger i realized that the evil sinner dev meant to say 'press h to continue'. i must advise against that however.

visually, it looks like a game that requires 3-d glasses to play.  if i play this for more than 20 minutes, i will projectile vomit all over my pc. no worries there though, because the game is so short that nobody will ever play for that long. 

anyway, you have to take a ball and change it to the right color. there is a box with blue color and a box with red color etc. you need to put your ball into the right color or combination of colors to progress.  sounds easy enough, right? 2 weeks out of your mother's womb you knew that yellow and blue made green. it is never that easy, of course.

lets say you want to make green. you put your ball into the blue color square thing on the floor, and all is good. now you need to put it into the yellow square. here is where the game goes completely to shit.  you have about half a second of your colorball turning green like you want it. if you don't move with lightning fast speed, the ball is going to stay in the yellow for too long and turn to yellow. i did that first stupid colorball probably 10 times before i managed to get it to stay green. this is the mechanic that the entire game is centered around, and it is all kinds of fucked up.

the final nail in the old body of christ for me was when i got to level 3 or 4. i went to carry one of the colorballs, but it was so big that it literally blocked 95% of the screen. i can't play if i can't see. you can't tell me this was tested and someone just decided it was fine that nobody could see what they were doing. occasionally, the giant colorbll morphed into a giant colordonut so i could see through the middle, but i don't think that was intentional.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473698606  

so thats it. i'm never playing again. somehow i made it through half of the game anyway. it is not exactly bursting with content. 

lets all try something here before we go.  get a blue bible and a yellow bible. smash them together to make a green bible. now go throw it in the trash. that is where this game belongs. at least i would give you steam trading cards and a 'you threw away the bible you are going to hell' achievement.

god bless amen

1) I changed to ""press H to continue"".
2) It's a visual effect. I have it reduced. Hopefully no more vomiting.
3) Many people have made a video about the game, a lot of game tester, and the problems are only from you. I do not know what the problem is. Can you make a video?
4) You can use the mouse wheel. Described at the beginning in the window that you could not close.

I've seen things come and go, and although I realise it's Early Access the development of side content rather than addressing some of the basic mechanics has been problematic at times.  I was very excited to have cars come, then more types of vehicles, then they got removed, and only 2 types of very bugged car were available.  There have been a number of fun additions, like new points of interest, but some of them (like the nuclear plant) have me disappointed.  I'm also an avid S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fan and it honestly seems like they were wanting to wrap that into the ever-creeping scope of the game.  And it destroyed one of my favorite corners of the map, I loved having a base up by the now-gone campground.
I've still kept playing, even with not being interested in the new bunker mutants or the broken fishing process.  However, with the 0.95 release I am finally out.  It has been uninstalled, and I have left the island.  I was here for a survival game and what was, in its original dynamic (and from what I could tell, intent) a survival game with zombies mixed in until real NPC interaction could happen in future updates.  In its dynamic now it appears to be headed more for a zombie game with some survival around them.  Walking through the forest I have a puppet appear 8 feet in front of me, and so I fight it.  Another one hears it, screams for backup, and within 15 seconds I'm dead.  Respawn, and it drops me right North of the nuclear plant, which is toxic without gear.
Speaking of gear, I did buy supporter packs 1 and 2 when they came out but there now seems to be many DLC packs for a game that is still in progress.  Given the cool features that have been introduced then taken away I'm not keen on spending more money on something that might get deleted at some point.
I'm sure there are many who love this game, and if you do, fill your boots.  As for me, I'm finally off the island.",1702805372,1702805372,False,13,0,0.6042173504829406,0,True,False,True,True,,1702898609.0,"Hello there OP. Thank you for taking the time to write this review and reaching out to us. 
We realize you've been playing for a long time and you've seen a lot of changes come to SCUM. 
Those changes were made with the best intentions and in keeping with our ultimate goal -> to make the 1.0 release the best it can be. 
With a team of only 55 people, making a game this ambitious means that sometimes some features have to take a back seat in order to finish up the high-priority ones. 
But, now that we're past 0.95 we will focus on adding some very important features along with polishing the game, so it will be in the best possible state when it releases with 1.0. 

This game was always planned as a survival game with Zombie (puppets) NPC's. 
And yes, the horde system drastically changes the way you play and we understand that it takes people some time to get used to ti. 
But also, this could be your opportunity for a fresh start, try a different tactic with the puppets. 

Having said all that, once we're in the polishing phase, that's when we'll revisit every single feature and do what we can to make them work even better.
We're sorry to hear you'll be leaving the Island, hopefully you'll revisit the game and perhaps change your mind. 
Have a great day!",513710

Once a Great Hall has been assigned to your Lord Manor, you will get the opportunity to promote villagers at the start of each month.

Thank you for the feedback.

I understand you're not keen onsharing the 3 roles and that's perfectly understandable, have you tried the single player modes via Skirmish, Sandbox and Survival?

As my thoughts of playing space engineers so far are great and the game can last up to hours of entertainment.

Unfortunately, while some aspects are great, there are [i]serious[/i] flaws that bring this game down in a massive way.

Pros:
- interesting lore
- very cool visuals and aesthetic

Cons:
- enemy design is sorely lacking, almost every enemy is a variation of one particular type
- the first section before you get to the open world is a bit too large in my opinion and starts feeling repetitive
- awkward and unresponsive controls sometimes, especially in fights. Your movement feels clunky and slow and your character will just not dodge at all sometimes despite spamming the dodge button. The platforming also sometimes suffers from this
- boss fight hitboxes are all over the place
- UI is weird, mixing up quick use items like health with keys and collectibles. Makes it hard to find what you need
- the game, while aesthetically interesting, is pretty low poly. As a result it's baffling how bad the performance gets in the open world
- platforming feels weird. The game encourages you to be creative and explore by giving you secret items early on, but later there are invisible walls everywhere. Making it somewhere really difficult only to be met with an invisible wall sucks. Either let us have freedom or not, and if you need to block something off, at least make it make sense with the level design
- there are forced perspective sections, where the camera shifts to be looking directly to the side of your character and you are locked into a 2D plane for that section. Words cannot adequately express just how much I [i]hate and despise[/i] these sections. In a souls-like game full of atmosphere, where there are cool visuals everywhere, let alone being aware of enemy placement and frequent insta-death falls, how [i]dare[/i] the designers restrict your motion and field of view? Honestly I was ready to put down the game after encountering this for the very first time. Devs: [b]never do this again[/b]!
- the game just does not respect your time at all. From infrequent checkpoints forcing you to run back to where you died (often, given the frequent platforming sections and awkward controls), to long load screens, to making you go back to the starting area to level up, to the quite frankly ridiculously long animations for backstabs and enemies getting back up, everything seems designed to waste your time

This pales in comparison to the bigger issue which is the movement. For some reason, there is no way to use the joystick for walking, and you can only use it for teleporting. which is incredibly difficult to use in combat and makes using two handed weapons almost impossible. If you want to walk normally, you are forced to use the small scroll wheel touchpad which makes moving sideways impossible, and along with this if you accidentally press a little too hard on the touchpad while you are trying to move it will open the teleport movement.

I'm sorry to hear that you've had difficulty with the game, in particular, the timed achievements.

As far as we are aware all the timed achievements should be completely possible in the current version of the game and it is simply not true that we have not updated the timers in accordance with the changes we've made to game balance, we regularly adjust these to ensure they're up to our standards, for example we revised quite a few in [url=https://wftogame.com/2-0-1-release-notes/]Patch 2.0.1[/url]. Some of these achievements are meant to be a challenge but should be entirely doable, if you believe that any achievement is unachievable then please let us know and we'll investigate to see if they need further adjustments.

We're always eager to take feedback and happy to be challenged by our community, we have a strong relationship that we intend to maintain for many years to come. If there are genuine concerns rest assured we will listen.

I *VERY* much want to play this game four dozens -- perhaps hundreds -- of hours, but can't even continue the campaign without a substantial system upgrade to bring it into the stable 20-30FPS range.   It's 5-10FPS on large maps for me right now.  Maybe next year?

So I suppose I should move on and leave a review as a post mortem. 
Up front I'll say that I stopped playing because I'm just done with the game. There was no shocking change that made me quit. I've just had enough.

I'm not sure what makes a good idler and a bad one, to be honest. Reading other people's reviews it's hard to grasp what other people want out of these things. So I'll just have to detail what the game does and you'll have to decide if that's good or bad.

So the first thing I think should be covered is ""is this an idler or a clicker?"" I would say this is an idler because the only component that benefits from clicking (your familiar's DPS) becomes incredibly useless after a few hours of playing. It sort of helps when you rebirth and are level 1 again, but not by enough to matter. And it doesn't help at all with progression.

The next point is how attentive you need to be. There are only a couple things you need to pay attention to: when you hit a wall and want to go back a few stages to leave your guys to grind. And timer missions. The shortest timer mission is ~20 minutes (with upgrades). These are those missions you see in phone games where you just click ""start"" and then once the timer completes you turn in the quest. So that means you, at most, are checking the game every 20 minutes. There's also some daily quests you have to fiddle around to complete each day. Those take about 30 minutes to do, I think? I've seen some people say this game requires too much attention. I don't think so. I find this to be a good amount. The most interaction you get is when you try to push progression by spending levels and using consumables. By the time I was level 80 or so, I only did this every couple days. Eventually once a week. Maybe I was being lazy, but it didn't seem like pushing was always an option. You have to idle for long periods of time, as the genre goes.

The social aspect of the game is super easy. You have guilds and fellowships (which are like secondary mini-guilds that require no effort) but both can be joined using search tools. These don't take any effort on your part, unless you find some kind of weird hardcore guild (not sure how people manage to be hardcore here but they always exist). They both provide huge bonuses so you'd be a fool not to join them. There's a guild activity where you farm a crystal, but this takes mere seconds out of your day. Just about the least commitment needed to be ""fully active"" I've ever seen in a game, so I think it's nice.

Other than that, we have... STUFF. Lots of superfluous menus and bonuses and things to click on. It may look overwhelming in the screenshots, but they are introduced very slowly. Each thing doesn't take much to manage, and can be safely ignored for long periods of time. It adds a kind of management to the game, albeit a very casual and ""idler"" version of it. A lot of it is redundant, quite frankly, but it provides the illusion of depth. The most notable side content is the tank battles. The tank battles are pretty stupid. And kinda feel like a huge waste of time. But it's more bonuses so you do them. Again, they only take a few minutes out of your day (this is where a lot of that ""daily quest 30 minutes"" I mentioned earlier comes from).

In conclusion, I think this is a pretty good idler. Maybe my favorite so far? A lot of numbers and increasing them. The right amount of auto-play vs management. For example, I couldn't get into that AFK Arena because you have to click on every level to go to a new one. That's probably the most important part. The idle combat just keeps going and going without having to do a bunch of menu-ing. Checking once every 20+ minutes is good. Checking every minute is bad. That's where my head is at.

EDIT: I forgot to mention monetization. I actually wanted to give the game money since I was playing it so much. But I never did because none of the things you can buy seem necessary... or even worthwhile. So I guess that's a good thing. Although this may change in the future (or already has), you never know with f2p games.",1665769361,1665769578,True,0,0,0.0,0,False,False,True,True,,1665833470.0,"thank you very much for this review.

Race perfectly and the ai will be right behind you the entire time even if your vehicle is 50 points faster. Of course it's the same the other way around as well, you can eat shit in a ditch and be right behind the leader of the race 10 seconds later because they basically slow down to a crawl if you fall behind, which is incredible because as soon as you pull ahead of them by 5-6 seconds the ai can start to take perfect turns going twice as fast as you like the car is on rails instead of tires. Even worse is the fact that the game punishes you for using your breaks. It's legitimately faster to ride the side rail of a corner and hold the boost than to bother to slow down and take a proper turn.

PSA: I'm honestly super surprised I actually have to explain this here but to everyone commenting about the problem being connection or cpu or w/e else, rubberbanding ai is not a term for lagging. Rubber band AI refers to a feature of artificial intelligence found in racing titles that is designed to prevent players from getting too far ahead of computer-controlled opponents. 

Edit: I'm making a sidenote for all the people who are real grumpy about the bad reviews, the base of the game itself is nice. It feels great to freeroam around the map. The physics could have used a bit more tuning but aside from that the cars control as you would expect from a good arcade racer. The problem lies beyond that in the ai. The oponents can decide to hit warpspeed to catch up to you whenever they damn well please. It's not as obvious in disciplines like hypercar racing and the F1 syle discipline, but street races are absolutely atrocious to play. I honestly believe if Ubi went back and fixed some of their problems the game could be great, but as it is, it feels like a big mess.

Old review:
Like Dungeon Keeper 2. Just a bad version of it.
The game is still buggy as hell. Worst of all is the cursor, you just never know where exactly it is pointing. That is especially frustrating when trying to place prisoners in the torture chamber.

Edit 29.07.:

Hi, Lee

First of all, cool that you guys took the effort of replying here. Never saw a dev do that before!
I looked into what you told me and you're right. There is a light beam, I just never realized as it is very hard for me to see. So there is no real problem and sorry for claiming there would be one!

The bug happened in the introductory level for the prisons (2nd level of the red circle to the right in campaign mode I think). I enlarged the captured prison and later tried to move prisoners from the second one (with the lvl10 bard) to another, which resulted in the new prisoner being killed. The same happened for me when I picked up the lvl10 bard and dropped him in the same prison again. All the other prisoners ganked up on the new guy and killed him for good. 
As I never did this in later levels, I tried that as well and it doesn't appear to be a problem there, so I don't know if that was a special problem or not.",1437679182,1447090425,True,0,0,0.3983204960823059,9,False,False,False,False,,1438176734.0,"Hi Volvox Globator,

Sorry to hear that you're disappointed with the game.

The hand always points towards the tip of the index finger or pickaxe. The exception to this is when dropping units or objects. If you are holding something in your hand then a small purple godbeam will be placed in the world to indicate where the unit will drop.

Having played around with it a little I think we can make some improvements for patch 1.2 there, generally the unit in your hand is hiding the beam a little too much making it difficult to see where it will land.

While I was in game I also tested the bug you reported that moving a prisoner from one room to another will cause other prisoners to kill him but I wasn't able to replicate. Did you do anything particular with these prisoners or was there anything special about them?

I'll try to check back here tomorrow to see if you've responded if not can you post up a [url=https://forum.subterraneangames.com/threads/please-read-how-to-report-a-bug.4689/]bug report[/url] on our forums and we'll do our best to fix it.

Cheers,

Pros:

Has some cool idea that I had really wanted to check out.
Guild run territories
housing
a lot of freedome
varied skills

Cons:

Gameplay feels sluggish and dated
Total pay-to-win
Skills cannot be increased past 60 on a free account
sub based
Many areas are over-camped by higher level players killing off new characters (with what I read in chat)
Older Graphics

Overall, I wouldn't recommend the game until the sub-based premium is dropped and they adopt a GW2 style payment method. 

Increase in area size for the tutorial zones would help alleviate the horde of players swinging like freaks at the same 2 pigs. 

Finally the graphics could be overlooked but the game still feels sluggish.

So it has potential but the starter zone was full of people killing the same 2-3 pigs that actually spawned. After mentioning in ""help chat"" that i wasn't sure i was keen on the pay-to-win model, i get lagged out. Check the forums to find i've been IP banned. So that was neat.

Its good practice and has some fun courses.
I'd recommend it to anyone who is interesting in mini quad racing.


Negatives (these things are being worked on but this is what I see right now):
-Very Few possibilities for customization.  ( Ok, its because a physics update meant that  experimental data has to be re-gathered, but thats how it stands right now ).

-A lot of courses (at least the indoor ones, and multi-gp) are really hard, and feel closterphobic.  There are some easy and mediums but really most are labeled appropriately as 'hard'.  
I'd recommend a beginner fly the easy and mediums at
-Gates of Hell
-Airport
-Miami

-The course markers can be misleading.  This is the most annoying thing ever.  Theres the actual visible checkpoints and then theres these invisible ones that you can miss.  The tracks can be complicated and the green diamond often looks like it wants you to go here, but actually it wants you there (ok turning off lens distortion to fix this).  Also on some of the smaller tracks the red line that highlights the intended course can show you the completely wrong direction of some parts of the course path are close together.",1555639472,1555871886,True,3,0,0.0,1,True,False,False,False,,1555687100.0,"Hi Tytugg!!

Thank you so very much for your feedback! We really appreciate it! 

I'd like to address a few of your concerns, and say that they are very valid concerns, and we have fixes in place for all of them. 

-""The few possible customization's"": This is due to our most recent huge physics update that we did. We had to pull all the parts from the drones because we have to capture ALL new bench test date to reflect the new physics. Unfortunately this process takes a very long time. Here's a clip of what it takes to get those parts in the sim: https://youtu.be/hm4EQfMQShY ... So with every update going forward we will be adding more and more of those parts along with brand new ones!!

The hard courses: Yes there are a lot of challenging courses, we are in the process of currently making more beginner friendly courses, however there are a number of easier course built by the community that could help you in the meantime, but more will be coming in little by little!! 

As for the bug with the green diamond check points, there is a known issue with them if you have the ""Lens Distortion"" feature turned on in your settings. Can you check your settings in the option menu to see if you have it turned on, if so, try turning it off and see if that resolves the issue you are encountering. We're working on a fix for it, but it requires an entire overhaul of the checkpoint system to fix this. I'm sorry about that, its a tricky one.

As for the red line... the courses that our community makes or we make through the map editor will have an issue with the red line when dealing with multiple tracks, so yes you are correct that there's an issue for sure.. lol.. but the official DRL tracks shouldn't have any issues with the line, because we create that differently then the way the redline is made through the editor, so a fix for that will be in the future as well. I know its a pain.. trust me.. it bothers us when were playing as well... So for that.. I'm sorry...But please send me a message on any specific tracks that have issue with the red line or checkpoints so we can get them fixed. I've sent you a request. 

So with all that said, again.. Thank you so very much for the feedback. We have fixes in the process for all the concerns you've brought up. I just wanted to take the time to let you know, so that you are aware that your money spent on our sim, is certainly going towards making this the best sim on the market. 


Also join our Discord Server: its very active with a lot of community members, info, tips and tricks, help related stuff, live stream links etc etc. https://discord.gg/b9RZ5yZ

WILL YOU QUIT ADDING DLC CHARACTER SKINS TO THIS UNFINISHED GAME IT DOESN'T NEED THEM RIGHT NOW!!!

I like this game it has great potential and when 1.0 releases and mod support comes out it will be played by all but until then wait on buying and playing.

A few things i would like to see added/fixed,
-Remove the limping when you hurt your arms, seriously this makes no sense I understand low health slowness but this needs reworked.
-Ability to open/shut the car doors when in and not driving.
-Puppets need more work, don't like swinging through them when they're a little to close.
-Would have been cool to see a new puppet for the horde screamer.
-Quit adding character skins they're not bringing players back to the game especially at $15.
-add a drink/eat button without having to open the inventory
-last one and most important add weights and the ability to do push-ups its a prison game come on, like do you see people using the wheel barrel for leveling strength and go yeah that's all we need.",1710438640,1710438640,True,78,6,0.8544881343841552,7,True,False,True,True,,,,513710

Other missions can be a nice break from checking papers loop, but driving and shooting is very basic, not much of a challenge or fun.

Everytime I open my inventory or my character menu there is a 60% chance my game will freeze.  So i have had to save everytime i want to look at a weapon or level up.  
Alt tabbing also slows the game down or freezes it.  
Tree hugger (an ability for a character) also has a chance to completely freeze the game

I am not alone with these bugs ( have been active in the forums trying to get things sorted out) and I cant reccommend this game in the state it is in now.  Plus the fact that the opening credits are unskippable so everytime I crash to desktop I have to resee the companies that rushed this out.

It's a little budget mmorpg with simple graphics but really cool humor and solid gameplay.
The quests are kill this, fetch that, activate things but it's okay because the gameplay is really good and the npcs are really funny.

The cut scenes are really well made and the dialogue ""shot-counter shot"" style cinematics remind me of old good time of games like Skies of Arcadia on Dreamcast (a lot of gesticulation by the characters, no voice over, loud music).

It seems there is a lot of collectibles (weapons, armor sets, cosmetics) and  most of them are not reserved to payed players.

The only annoying thing are the musics. They're well-crafted but they're basically 30 seconds loops. And don't try to cut them unless you like total silence, since there are no ambient sounds (a part footsteps and fighting sounds).

I really enjoy this game. I played today because I was tired by waiting queues in New World and because it's quick to install (123mg), but I realize I will probably play Adventure Quest 3D this night rather Amazon's blockbuster.

Option menu is extremely unreliable, settings will save at random and can even change themselves after loading into a match.

You start out with a minibird and a handful of troops. The chopper is extremely clunky, soldiers will only fire at things from their side which would be fine except turning the chopper to the correct side for your troops to fire from it is a difficult and sometimes tedious problem.

The pathing is absolutely horrendous especially in chokepoints, the final straw for me was when I tried to have a squad of 8 soldiers pass over a bridge, they would not follow the formation I set and kept walking back and forth, not following my directions.

Still needs some work but has alot of content and is becoming a beautiful game, my previous review should be below I think. (not sure how the reviews work as this is the only one I have reviewed so far)

---------------

I think this is my first review, I feel it is warranted to discuss some thoughts for those considering purchasing this game.
Firstly I love this genre of game, big fan of banished (450 hrs played) and feel this game will be the next step up from that

Overall I wish I could mark my recommendation as neutral with potential - Have marked as Not Recommended at the moment largely based on the pricing for this stage of an Alpha product however the Devs seem to be motivated in updating it regularly and does have alot of early game enjoyment and stability.

Positives:
- Gridless building is great, the freedom to place buildings almost anywhere gives it a natural look and feel.
- Natural sprawl, (not for everyone from the videos I have watched) I like that towns people build their houses in their own way (within your set zone) and create their own paths/roads making each gameplay unique
- Dev humor, if you look close you can see parts of the developers personalities come through with the kooky cartoony characters and little puns/jokes but not overdone to take the shine off the overall feel of the game
- Early Gameplay, has been fleshed out very well, the buildings and features work well to encourage further gameplay
- Art Style, to me this is an appealing artstyle, soft on the eye and allows enough color and creativity to make your city truly yours without ruining the settler/medievil style.
-  The Devs are updating the game on a regular basis

Negatives:
- Expense, for an  alpha with a long way to go I took a gamble on paying what I rarely pay for a fully produced game, the first couple of hours I was happy but once the mid/late game lack of content and bugs arose I would have refunded if I could. (keeping in mind I am a poor family man :P )
- Mid/late Gameplay - after the first couple of hours it is obvious that the game is not complete, there are buildings and resources with little or no purpose as yet and functionality of those buildings is lacking and leaves you void of progression in any way other than to continue to expand the existing services. For an Alpha I don't mind a lack of polish such as names of units being ""male2538"" and general bugs but when I hit a lack of progression speaks a bit about flow design and how it appears to be a bit rushed out at this stage. In saying that I can see where they are going with it and just hope it continues.
- You are a game tester paying a premium price
- No real tutorial, if you are not use to games like Banished then you could get lost quickly 

In Summery:
This has SO much potential to be a brilliant city builder if the devs can follow through with what they have started. If you love the genre and happy to watch the game develop over time and hope that it reaches its true potential for it's premium price then this is a good purchase for you. I recommend holding off on your purchase until the development has progressed, though without funding it may not progress, Catch 22. If it were half the price or you have the extra cash to splurge (unlike me :( )I would say absolutely give it a go.

Happy Building :)",1549848347,1587645099,True,2,0,0.5278190374374389,20,True,False,True,False,,1559904097.0,"Hi Bear,

Thanks for the honest and open review! As a small Indie team, all feedback is very important to us.

We are in heavy development whilst in Early Access and there is much more content, gameplay and challenge to come. We hope as we release more content and refine the game we will be able to earn a positive review.

As you have probably seen there is a help menu (?) and initial quests that guide you through the early game but we recognise the need for a tutorial in the future.

Thanks again for the great feedback!

It's similar to Surviving Mars but without the large dome management and the management is much more straightforward.

However, my biggest issues with the game have to do with the colonist/robot AI. The AI has great difficulty handling a large amount of tasks in the early game and multi-tasking is troublesome. While you can prioritize structures to build first, building individual components within rooms with prioritization is not possible. I would also suggest that the AI follow prioritization by needs of the colonists. For example, if the colonists are all getting very tired and sleepy, that they prioritize building bunks over the other less essential structures. In addition, I would recommend starting the game with more colonists to give some more wiggle room in the early game building process. If your engineer dies for whatever reason (such as natural meteor disaster or power grid failure) and the building bots go into very poor condition, it's very easy to hit a state where the game is guaranteed to be a failure.

Lastly, this is a small thing but the amount of techs and milestones is a bit on the lean side of things. Most of the milestones are very easily achievable in the short term.

First off I really enjoyed this game and I think if you enjoyed DK1 and 2 then you will probably enjoy this game too. I played through both the main campaign and heart of gold, and I would recommend both to anyone who enjoys this type of strategy game.  

A lot of reviews recently seem to be complaining about this being all about clicks per second (CPS) because they feel they are rushed and they are unbale to beat the levels. One reviewer claimed its basically impossible to beat some levels without going to YouTube and watching tutorials. I completely disagree. 

Admittedly, there are a few levels that were very hard the first couple times I tried them, but I think it’s a bit silly to buy a game and assume it is not going to challenge you. if it was not a challenge, then what’s the point? I play RTS games very slowly and methodically, building up my base and my units until I can overpower the enemy. You will notice, this is exactly the opposite of what a lot of the reviews are claiming you have to do in order to beat levels.

There are a couple levels that did force me to play faster than I normally do, but again, that is part of the fun. Otherwise it would just be the same thing over and over. I had to replay these levels a couple of times before I came up with a strategy that worked, and it felt rewarding once I had figured it out! 

A couple of tips for players if you need some help:

1 - in the gameplay options menu, there is a game speed slider. on levels I was having difficulty with, I moved the slider down to 50% so that I had more time to plan things out and build up my rooms. some levels I played almost entirely this way. I would hop in and out of that menu a couple times in a map usually to adjust the speed of the game.

2 - You can most definitely funnel enemies. if you are having trouble figuring out the way to funnel enemies, there’s a sandbox map you can play in the campaigns that allow you infinite money and time to build up a dungeon and allow you to call waves of enemies when you are ready which will allow you to test out defense setups. I was able to make a kill room that would handle a full wave of level 10 enemies by itself. I used this setup a number of times during the campaign, so it’s not like it requires infinite resources to do.

3 - Like most games like this, as long as you give the enemies a way to get into your base that is not too far away from where they naturally want to enter, they will take the route you give them instead of cutting a path of their own. A point to be made here though is that some defenses (the blade flower and the rampart for example) do not allow minions or enemies to walk through them. So, that would count as a blocked path, which means that the enemies might decide to cut their own path instead of taking the one you gave them. Doors and whatnot are fine since the enemies will understand that they need to attack them.

Comments to the devs (if they are listening :)
As I mentioned above, I played around with the speed setting a lot. I think a more fluid way to adjust game speed would be nice. like simply using the + and - keys to adjust the speed on the fly. 

Another thing I would have loved to have is the ability to pause the game and look around. basically, just stop time and let me move my camera around and interact with the props. The ability to mark areas for mining and marking out defenses/constructs would also be great to do while paused, though I could see how this might be ""over powered.""",1562035295,1562035316,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,,,230190

Seeing that you have put roughly 55 hours into this game means you've been entertained for about 36 cent per hour which is quite a good ratio in my opinion.
I'm sorry to hear you thought it would be more of an RTS. It is a tactical base defense game (like advertised). A mixture between RTS and tower defense, build your base and defend it. It's much more complex than a regular tower defense game and also brings much more tactics into it. The game has been developed by my wife and myself over 4 years and we tried to put as much content into it as possible.

 - Story campaign mode with voice acting (English + German) and three different difficulty levels
 - Skirmish mode with two game play options and procedural wave generation
 - Map editor with steam workshop integration
 - Twitch mode
 - Complete soundtrack

and all packed in unique, atmospheric graphics oh and it is localized in 9 different languages too!
I'm pretty sure none of the free games on Kongregate has the same amount of content with such a high production value. All the hard work can't come for free, we have bills to pay. And because of the fact that you've played the game for this long means that somehow the game had to be good for you. 
Anyway, maybe I could change your mind. And maybe or hopefully you will see games from a different perspective in the future.

For an early access game this game has alot of content, Adventure Quest is a little repetetive but simple, not like other games where you have to grind for days for craft items and then wait more days just to finish crafting said items. Adventure Quest 3D has simplicity but is also challenging enough to keep players engaged, some quests are repeteive but the rewards in the end are worth it!

You can only use the 'move your hands by your side' locomotion that is far from perfect in a game like this.
Steam SS does not work! (I have no idea why) 

So.... imo this is triple A garbage!

P.S: I have tried to delete that folder, reinstall the game and edit that value (that was 100.000000 to 100.0000) but nothing helped. I did not find any way to make the game playable again. Now it always starts with the eyes switched.

If you dont want the game to be the source of arguments with people around you about how you spend your time. 

If that is not the case, and you want a great game with a great community, Foundation is for you! :)

Solid thumbs up!

Put about 20 hours into Football Tactics so far, I'm about ~40% done achievement wise and played through 5 seasons so far.

The game is very promising, there is a glimmer of what could be a very good tactics game, unfortunately, it's a pretty shitty football game. The AI is very binary, and with the RNG dice rolls and the way the AI gets players makes the game inherently unfair. For example;

My last game the opposing team had a Goalkeeper with ~90 defence and one Striker with ~65 Accuracy. The rest of their team was awful and did not impact on the team at all. As my Strikers are ~40-50 Accuracy and my Goalkeeper is ~50 defence, no matter how I attacked it was impossible to score, no matter how their team attacked it was impossible for them not to score. Result, 6-0 loss.

This is further exasperated by the AI. The AI knows that the Striker will score every shot. This means every turn for the AI consists of 2 passes to that striker, and a shot from max range that will always score. That's right, their League 3 Striker scored [b]6 50yard screamers in one match.[/b]


Add to this a lack of crossing or headers, defenders moving one square only (no wing backs in this game...) there are no actual football tactics in this football game. Nearly every match relies on using your best passer to play down the middle to your best striker, score. Reset, do the same again.

I've seen matches where both myself and the AI can score in 3 moves from kick off, lots of 6-6 or 7-7 draws etc. in this game.

The way the RNG works can also lead to massive swings. Whatever the stat is for your player is the max they can roll. So if you have a defender with 25 defence they will roll a D25 for every action, if the Striker has 50 Accuracy they will roll a D50. The Striker is almost guaranteed to win every dice roll.

The skill system is obtuse and doesn't always seem to trigger, a lack of defensive options (Pressing and ending the turn seemingly has zero affect on the AI), AI bonuses leading to whichever 3 teams were relegated nearly always winning the league by huge margins and a lack of management simulation, I really can't recommend the game. The training and sim systems are particularly bad, with players being sold/bought on a whim without needing to go to a team, you can't choose what to train your players in (skills are randomly allocated) and a lack of any real management beyond buying some one shot upgrades for bonus exp.

To finish up fully, I could see myself needing to grind for 20-25 seasons slowly leveling up players. [b]It's often better to deliberately lose games and finish fourth for several seasons than get promotion to a new league.[/b] Every draw and loss has a chance to lose you fans and reduce your income on a weekly basis.

However, from your review, I see that one important part of the game wasn't clear for you. And it hugely affected your experience. 

This feature is Skills. 

When you master using them, when you start developing your team to get the maximum from the skills, you will see the tactical depth of Football Tactics. Pass+Pass+Kick is tactics for an Amateur League. To win the stronger opponents with higher stats, you have to use skills smartly.

We know that currently, it is explained not very well in the game. So I will write there few important notes:
- the skills are not available after kick off
- the skills give +1 bonus action after performed successfully _against an opponent_

So there aren't bugs in which the skills do not trigger. It's just the cases we haven't explained well.

Other than that, there are few additional notes.

1) You might feel that we intentionally affect RNG to be unfair for the players. But it's not true. There aren't any reason for us to do that. 

2) We wanted Football Tactics to simulate the random nature of the football when even stronger footballers just play badly the whole match. The RNG simulates it. But if you don't like it, start a new campaign and select an option ""Less random"". With this option, the effect of the RNG will be decreased significantly. 

3) No matter whether you play with this option or not, when you master using skills and building your team with needed skills, you will see that on the big scale RNG doesn't affect your results much. As in real football - if your team is strong, and the tactics is smart - some random losses won't stop you.

4) We are working on the next huge update which will add headers, crosses and other football elements to the game. The game will be much deeper http://steamcommunity.com/games/375530/announcements/detail/590375319499622407

\/ My original Review \/

The Game itself is great!
But paying for newly released blocks?
I love Keen for the great work they did, up until now, but I refuse to let this become the new standard for this game.

Edit:
I recieved a reply from Keen Software!
In short, it looks like Keen thinks this will not split the comminity since the paid blocks only contain decorative stuff not effecting gameplay ... call me nitpicky, but this proves not to be true:

The cockpit is in fact not decorative, it is a functional Block. A cannot enter or use ships build with this kind of block, limiting acces only to paying players.

There is also the point of differnt placement possibilities and such, but that seem to be short of my argument above.",1554750840,1559588501,True,0,0,0.6239120364189147,0,True,False,False,False,,1554888424.0,"
Hi Mr. Trikoder,

Thank you for writing this review.

We really appreciate your feedback.

We are continuing to release free features for Space Engineers via updates, (Customizable LCD Screens, Replay Tool, Steam Badges. Steam Backgrounds, etc.) and optional paid DLC (the Decorative Pack), which is designed to not split our community. For more information please see Marek Rosa's blog: https://blog.marekrosa.org/2019/04/space-engineers-customizable-lcd.html

We are also continuing to optimize Space Engineers and fix numerous bugs in the game.

If you are experiencing any issues, please message us via our support site: https://support.keenswh.com/spaceengineers/general and we'll be happy to assist you.

Kind regards,

I'm sorry to hear that you're disappointed with the game and the range and breadth of issues you've faced with it. I can completely understand your frustrations and we're always happy to try and help where we can, we believe in offering support as quickly, diligently and comprehensively as possible and as you know we have responded to your three bug reports [url=http://brightrockgames.userecho.com/topics/2758-invoking-a-potion-locks-up-ui/]here[/url], [url=http://brightrockgames.userecho.com/topics/2756-invisible-stuck-beast-cant-find-food-or-lair-and-produces-errors/]here[/url] and [url=http://brightrockgames.userecho.com/topics/2757-mouse-delay-on-menus-and-throughout-game/]here[/url]. It's of great regret that we weren't able to assist you in your issues and one remains under investigation for future balancing but I hope you'll agree that at the very least we spent the time to discuss at length with you the issues and investigated what we could with the information provided, we would very much still like to know your system specs so we can see if we have a similar PC for future testing particularly to discover if indeed the AI is falling over for some units on a certain kind of rig.

We completely recognise how disappointed you were in your purchase and as mentioned previously although we cannot personally issue refunds on Steam purchases we would be more than happy for you to request a refund from Steam support with our blessing. We do know it is possible to have a game refunded even if it is beyond the 2-hour cutoff and we hope that our advocacy in this matter would allow Steam customer service some leeway in processing it.

There were a few important points I wanted to address here for the benefit of other customers. Firstly that we take all feedback and complaints very seriously, we have set up extensive support structures and ways for our customers to contact us directly and we review and respond to all feedback as soon as we can. We always take whatever steps are within our ability in order to resolve issues and in most cases the majority of reported issues and bugs will be addressed in as timely manner as we can manage.

It is known that Coherent UI causes issues on some systems, mostly when systems do not reach the minimum or recommended requirements and in the rare exception even when they do. Sometimes when the UI appears laggy it is simply because the Coherent UI process is being starved of system resources whether this is CPU, GPU or RAM, in most cases though it's often limited by the CPU or GPU. This is a result of a number of factors but primarily the sheer complexity of the dungeon itself. Few games go to the lengths that WFTO does especially without using a custom engine with all units running their own autonomous AI and acting in accordance with behaviours. Deformable terrain causes complex pathfinding problems and the number of units can easily overwhelm a lesser specced CPU.

We are in the process of researching a move to a more modern version of this middleware and hope that the performance improvements could benefit some of the lower specced rigs amongst our customers as well as resolve some of the remaining issues without requiring some common workarounds with incompatible systems. There's no timeline for this yet but we're hoping that if we can get it in then it will be in the next major patch for WFTO. As for the future, we're confident that we will be deploying a more bespoke solution for future games.

Naturally, we're always looking for optimisations of our own and have some planned to go in both in the near future and in the longer term for the next major patch and we'll be scouring our code for improvements that we can make. However, we do believe that a minimum G3D score of 1500 (a score easily beaten by even most modern low-end cards and doubled for sub $100) is the absolute minimum required to run the game. Though the recommended score of 3000 should easily be attainable with cards that nearly double it available at retail for less than $140. We also recommend at least a well-specced CPU and 8GB of RAM. 

Most of the issues you covered in this review were also the ones we looked at for your bug reports though to cover a few more things. You can easily pay minions by using the Gild spells as well as dropping gold directly onto them, you can also move gold to vaults where you need it. Though I think there is some solid feedback that is worth looking into which is how units determine where to get their gold from. Currently they will locate the closest vault with gold which makes sense but we might be able to make them draw from the tiles rather than the gold piles themselves so provided a vault has gold they will be able to draw the gold if they can reach a single tile in that vault, another alternative that is under consideration is allow the gold vortex to work both ways so it can be used to pay minions from your gold reserves. Workers will always try to place gold in the closest vault, to reduce travel time so you'll find that some vaults may never be filled unless they have a local gold source. However, rituals like Avarice will fill vaults at random.

With regards to the pause feature, this is not exactly true though I know what you are referencing. The issues in question are with allowing the player to take actions while the game is paused as opposed to pausing the game itself, there are twofold issues here. Firstly there is no way to provide user feedback and it can have unintended consequences for the gameplay. If a player ""queues"" actions while paused then they will see no immediate feedback to their action as they would if the game was running, likewise queueing actions such as a slap could have serious unintended consequences, further to that its just not in the design intent to allow players to pause the game in this way. As with most coding, there's rarely an insurmountable issue but this particular one has some roadblocks that would require a lot of work for the limited gains. However, I can definitely see the value in having a pause state where you can look around and review your units so I'll see what we can do.

The cultists not returning to work is likely caused by a lack of research being required. If you have researched enough sins to unlock everything then further research will not be undertaken. They will instead look to train up or perform other tasks.

Again I'm truly sorry that the game did not match your expectations and left you feeling disappointed. If nothing else we're always willing to take feedback on board and address concerns, complaints and issues where we can and with each patch we know that the game gets better and better.

Sorry once more and I understand your decision to not support us as a developer in the future.

Take care,

Lee

Hi I'mNotYourBro,

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2017. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the performance and stability of the game has been now greatly improved after huge amounts of development from our two-man code team. 

There is also now the second expansion, the Crucible survival mode, that was free for all! 

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

[b] The Good: [/b]  Fun characters with lots of personality.  I have almost cried from some of the things the duck says.  Voice acting is very good.  The graphics are nice and the maps are interesting.  

[b] The Meh?: [/b]  I don't mind playing the entire game from a stealth mode perspective, however, if you do mind this, I would steer away from this game as it is mandatory in order to survive.  The rewards are dicey, and until you reach the end of the game where you've completed everything, you don't have enough gear, trade goods for upgrades, or skills.  This makes it very challenging.

[b] The Bad (and in my humble opinion this is the crux of it): [/b]  This game may be fun to play, but it is very short, and really not replayable for the price ($35 US).  The blatant ""we will not have a presence on the Steam forums"" statement from Funcom is outrageous.

It is very sad when the Dev's, Publishers, and the Community Managers (who both work for the publisher), have a whopping total of 4 posts, none of which address any of the feedback, bugs, or general questions that the Steam community has posed.  Two of the posts were the typical set up, and two were concerning glitches and instructions for receiving the deluxe editions at the release of the game.  The Bearded Ladies are a Swedish game consulting group listed as the Dev's which is whom you would normally be conversing with.  They have been absent on the forums and discussion boards.  Funcom, a Norwegian game developer and the listed Publisher has been around for 25 years with titles like The Secret World, The Longest Journey, and most recently Conan Exiles (which they really really care about).  

I would rather give my money to an indie dev, that understands the various gaming communities, is working on the best title they can produce, and will be interactive, and/or, have a community manager (which can be a game fan that communicates with them) to address the community at large.  Bottom line-don't release a title on a platform you are not going to actively be part of and support.

Just my 1.5 cents.

[b] FUNCOM [b] Response to your comments concerning my review.  You guys have been in this industry for 25 years and should know better!  Having someone as a true community representative should've been completed prior to releasing the game.  Note that as of today you have yet to respond to a SINGLE one of the 806 (and counting) general discussion, questions, bugs, and comments posted.

Let me start with this: I left this game around early 2020; that is, I stopped following its updates, stopped playing on a next to day to day bases, and overall left communities I had been part of since 2017; (maybe 2016, honestly I can’t recall) this was my main game in those periods (as you can see by the hours tell), I left though because I found more dissolution between the community and the dev’s; and me feeling that the dev’s felt that they prioritised new content over fixing or fleshing out pre-existing content. Overall that previous review was more of a frustration as a long-time player, and hence why I left the game retroactively, giving it a bad review,
But what’s changed? Now? Why positive? Well as of 27/07/22, I found myself moving out from home and into my own flat, and long short I had no internet for 2 weeks, and my go to games (Sea of Thieves, halo MP, Age of Empires 2) these days all require internet; I found myself stuck for entertainment, that’s when I realised, I had Space Engineers installed still. So, for those 2 weeks I found myself playing it and quite enjoying it; bringing back a passion for it even, made me remember why I wanted to have this game, ever since I saw the yogscast play it, and even the reason why I wanted to get into PC gaming in the first place… 
Its because of this game, it’s fun, put simply, they have nailed that no doubt, and the slogan about creativity and exploration does stay true! 
A lot has changed (or at least from what I remember) from when I last played it, in vanilla, as someone in the past who use to use a lot of mods to flesh out the game, playing it in vanilla (as I had no workshop items because no internet) made me realised how much the game has evolved and how much vanilla has changed, even fleshed out, I had a lot of my old Blueprints on old USB thumb drives, and I’m finding myself spawning them in, half or mostly missing, and trying to refit them into a vanilla style, and to say I had fun, it was like playing with Lego, but in space! I find myself wanting to play more of it. (Though there are 1 or 2 mods I still wish I had…. Larger ramps and seats mainly) 
The dev’s have done amazing things to the game, and I can appreciate that a lot; I still have gripes with the DLC (being someone who thinks that its content that shouldn’t be charged for), I cant say with the community side or developer relationships to the community, but overall I recommend it.",1522170176,1658914761,True,0,0,0.4893031120300292,1,True,False,False,False,,1523532405.0,"Hello Shallows, 

Please let me respond on behalf of Keen Software House. 

First of all, thank you for your feedback. We are trying our best to address all comments and concerns from our players, especially from those who spent significant amount of time playing our games. 

The performance issues are currently being worked on. It's always a challenge with such dynamic and open world we have in Space Engineers. We optimize one thing, fix it, or add new feature and it always opens a door to new use cases, new limits and new stress levels for the game. Then we must optimize again and look at all options. Space Engineers multiplayer is currently our priority and I can say that we have reached nice improvements in its performance. As we moved towards having the major releases only, we can spend all of our time on major updates and we hope that it’ll bring significant improvements and changes to our game.

Or when you crawling upwind and some guy on ships with same square sails moving 5 times faster than you chases you,sinks your ships and leaves just because!

Or funny battles near friendly ports where defenses wont protect you.

And this funny unskippable battle at game start when you die and got to start again was made purely for steam 2 hours anti refund rule. You just cant start the game,see mechanics etc. you need to spend 1 hour on first mission.

The sailing, fishing, and a handful of other minor features are nice, but remain underdeveloped. There was immense potential here, from ship combat to battling monsters at sea, a dueling system to reputation with pirate sects. None of that will come about, apparently.

All this is as of full release is a sailing simulator, and while that's somewhat decent (compass, sextant, other tools help make sailing feel involved, not to mention that you have to be your own cartographer), there isn't enough there to justify the price.

Instead we focused our efforts on quests, loot, exploration and discovery, and multiplayer and tried to add as much content in that regard as possible.

Problem solved!

It used to have stealth mechanics, but they were completely based on character stats and had nothing to do with moving carefully or hiding in cover; ergo, broken, so now there is no more stealth.  Problem solved!

Overall the game suffers from a bad case of ""Made with Unity"" (i.e. expect to get less than half the FPS here that you would normally get playing Skyrim at max graphics) and an even worse case of ""Made in Russia.""  Despite all the talk of improving customization, your character choices are sleazy looking white male or sleazy looking white female, as is literally [i]every[/i] other character in the game regardless of their faction.  If you're ever wondering which equipment to buy or equip just grab whatever looks the most Russian because for some [i]strange[/i] reason it will miraculously outperform everything else in the game, every time.

Most of the real problem, however, is that it's trying too hard to be ""Mount & Blade + Guns"" as opposed to, say, a FPS version of Jagged Alliance 2.  Look, M&B works because it's got swordsmen on foot, archers, horses, mounted archers, lancers, spearmen, formation tactics, and several [i]diverse[/i] factions based on different real world cultures.  And while every battle starts off at a distance (just like here), there is enough terrain variance to make terrain actually mean something.  Those horse archers that kicked butt in the open desert turn out to be nearly helpless when trying to defend a castle wall and conversely Nord Huskarls don't last long against horsemen in the open.

In F:GW, however, there is only one troop type (i.e. white dude with a gun), one terrain type (low woodland hills) and urban combat may as well not even exist because the AI (both yours and the enemy) aren't capable of using any of its cover - not that there's really much to begin with.  City fights are just like every other fight except that you wait longer for the AI to figure out how to get out of town before your snipers blow them all away as they mindlessly rush towards you like always.

In other words, it turns out that the M&B medieval model simply [b]does not work[/b] with modern weapons and/or tactics.  Sorry, but it just doesn't.  Again, I think they'd have been better off trying to steal ideas from Jagged Alliance 2 and turning that into a FPS-type game instead.  Y'know, [i]actual[/i] urban warfare and tactics that are more than just saying ""move cautious"" or ""charge?""

Now I know they've been working hard on this and they've been really scrambling to squash all the bugs (there's a reason why Unity is free, guys - 'cuz it sucks) and I'm not trying to say that they don't know what they're doing or that they don't care.  They are putting forth a lot of effort and it is moving along just fine - but I just feel like it's moving in the wrong direction, and sadly I think that they're already too far along to change course.

It's sad because I liked the game a lot more when it first came out.  It wasn't until much later that I realized that the real problem wasn't the bugs or glitches but something in the very foundations.  No matter how hard you try you still just end up with the same thing every time - a battle between two forces on a summertime hillside that always goes to whoever has the most sniper rifles with ""Made in Russia"" stamped on them, whilst you, the player, sits there with binoculars hoping to actually spot an enemy at some point before the battle ends.

After about two or three of these non-events in a row I just want to go back and see if I can lure those damn Khergit horse archers into patch of thick forest and then see how they like it when their horses get stuck on the trees and my Rhodok spearmen end up surrounding them in a box formation... or maybe find out of if it's easier to capture San Mona from the east side at night using nothing but suppressed weapons, knives and lots of camo paint.  Here... I just feel like I'm watching an RTS game play against itself while I'm stuck in some kind of glitched observer mode that makes it look like I'm playing, too, even though I'm not.  Not really, at least.  I'm just watching a map from behind a rock, like always, and hoping that I brought more sniper rifles than the other guys... like always.

Stealth mechanics are just not added back yet, same as more content. Because we were remaking the game like from the most beginning in order to add modding support and some features.

All characters are white because of the game lore, as it is about the Eastern Europe. Everything happening in the same country, so of course different factions does not influence how people look like except clothes. ""The most Russian looking"" weapons are not the best ones, and we are still working on the weapons balancing in total.

WE ARE NOT TRYING TO BE  ""Mount & Blade + Guns"" , it's just the closest description of the game which people found. 

AI still wip.

We sailed for numerous hours, set our course over night via compass and then went to sleep, only to wake up and go back to sailing. Whether it were for fishing in distant regions, or sailing in force to attack the enemy in the mist of the morning sun. 

Nationwide battles for strategic harbors/ports. Well coordinated, everyone working together, with each their role to play. 
Nations had famous crafters/builders/PvP'ers and of course pirates!! 

Now.. the game is free to play, with game devs who has done nothing but sink this once great ship of a game. 
Ships are now set at a price, ""OVERPRICED"" where as you could craft/farm for them before. 
The game was realistic too, now there are runes and all sorts of ""unrealistic"" elements shoved in there to try and help all of the mistakes done before, and all the stuff that didn't get done. 

I put roughly 500 hours into this game, went hard to be someone in my nation and put my mark on the map in the pvp world.

It also seems that the zombies adapt at a horrifying rate, by the time I was able to secure the smaller side and wall it off they had most of the remaining island, this led to several new zombie variants that were hard to kill and killed a lot harder.

My main peeve is that the ""zombie towers of death"" where the new zombies spawn from pop up unrealistically quick, as in I'll see 30ish zombies run to a spot and then a tower pops up almost immediately.

The infected do adapt and change as you play mutating as the game progresses to create newer infected. You can combat this by using creeping artillery barrages and  using the special abilities of units to lock down positions. The heavy and Sniper are invaluable for taking control of zones mid-late game.

Its not recommended to attack during Hordes but instead do so doing times of calm.

There are top10 guilds where people spent thousands of dollars just to be on top! These people literally pay the devs salaries and keep the game alive..cos hey,..who's supid enough to pay 400 bucks for one card!?

[u] DISCLAIMER! [/u] 
I got a Steam Key from the developer. 
HOWEVER, I got it for Beta Testing purposes. I am Beta-testing the Mac version. I will also be naming some cons. I'm not biased ;)

But, since I tried it out on my gaming PC, I thought I might as well leave a review.

[b] On with the review! [/b]


First of all, the pros. 

[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
	[*]Good graphics! Because it’s made in Unreal4, that’s to be expected. 
	[*]Voice acting is surprisingly good ^-^
	[*]Quite a few different ships (6 in total)
	[*]Cool sound effects
        [*]Easy to install! Worked on DK2 very well. 
        [*]Works well with the Steam Controller.
        [*]Each ship is super different. They each have a different HUD, speeds, and sometimes different weapons. 
        [*]Stealth mode is awesome! You can't see through your windows, but use a black and orange monitor to navigate! And the sounds it make add to the atmosphere! 
[/list]

[b] Mediocre: [/b]
[list]
	[*]Between loading screens, you have the default, endless, white void of the Steam VR set up. Not a real problem, but worth mentioning. This is a problem with SteamVR, not the game.
[/list]

[b] Cons: [/b]
[list]
        [*][strike]The crosshair is off centre. This might just be because of my set-up, but I’m not too sure.[/strike]
	[*]Sometimes there is a bit of doublevision. Might just be because I am using a DK2.
        [*]Some of the ships don't have the Stealth/Scout/Fighting/Flying modes. This might just be because of the type of ship, but it is something I noticed. Makes the Scout/Combat Fighter a bit less interesting.
        [*]Crazy fast AI Pilots!
[/list]

(Update: Aiming is fine. By moving my head down a little, the laser aligned with the crosshair. Hence why I removed that from the cons)

[u] Note to the devs! [/u]
The minumum requirements might be able to go down a little, as my GTX970 handelled it easily on highest graphics. But that might require further testing to find out if it can indeed be lowered. 



Anyway, I do recommend it. 
Right now it’s a  7/10. 
With the cons fixed I’ll up it to an 8/10 or a 9/10.",1463067202,1463129938,True,5,0,0.5248742699623107,3,False,True,True,False,,1501118367.0,"Thank you for your feedback.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. One of these are completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate
- Entirely new Skirmish AI

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

First of all Steam support was no help.
I ended up using Microsoft edge as a default web browser. DON'T USE MICROSOFT EDGE!!! It was a major part of my problems. It ends up blocking task bars and other things on the Frontier sites. 
I ended up using the Brave web browser, that worked WAY BETTER!!

Using Edge I could not setup an account. It would not accept my email or password. I even created several emails to see if I was doing something wrong. Nope, it was Microsoft Edge some how blocking things. I could not properly enter account information to be accepted/validated for Frontier because of this.

DON'T USE MICROSOFT EDGE WEB BROWSER!!!!

Once I used Brave and it worked way better! 
I was able to create a desktop shortcut for the game from inside Steam. Then launched the game with the desktop short cut. In the Elite dangerous window I clicked login, which brings you to the Frontier website. 
I clicked on ""My Account"" tab and selected dashboard. Which opens up a list on the left. Which you then need to select ""Partner keys"". This opens a window that allows you to click on a green area marked "" Login using Steam"". 
You then need to enter your Steam account name (not your player name!) and your Steam login password. 
You should receive an email with a validation code. You enter that code and enter Frontier's website. 
From this point you should be golden, and just a couple minutes from playing.

Honestly I spent over 25+ hours trying to get this to work. Only a family member who is more familiar with web browsers clued into what was wrong. I would never had known MICROSOFT EDGE was such a piece of garbage. I asked Steam for a refund before I found the solution and was denied since the game was running in the background (the login window I guess is considered ""the game"") and totalled just over 6 hours play time. Even though I never played a minute in game....

Needless to say Customer support/Steam is not in my good books

Good luck everyone.

So far its very relaxing and cute. I mean bakery, baking and fresh bread, what is there not to like :D It gives good vibes. 

Pros:
- Easy to play and with decent pace.
- All the goods look great and make u want to actually leave your house and go to a real bakery.
- There is a lot of time to bake so no stress if u mess it up.
- Decent number of recipies and its fun that there are different steps to make it work. 
- Enough of different machines to make it enjoyable.
- Baking is somehow very satisfying in this game.
- On the second upgrade of the bakery, we get to use eggs and the recipe just says 240g for example so you dont know how many eggs it is exactly and need to count how many of the big (60g) or the small ones (45g) to use. It was a bit annoying but it didnt matter because with level 3 of bakery there is a machine that measures it for you. After struggling with that annoying step it was very satysfying to work for this upgrade. I liked that. Its smilar with other upgrades, They make a difference. 
- When the city was still open and it was possible to drive around it was quite eerie. It wasnt too dark but it wasnt a day either. Everything was foggy at the edge of the city and at that time of the day when its getting light outside but not quite there yet. No people around and only few cars. Loved that atmosphere. Now you get get glipses of it while looking through the window of the bakery and at some point you can look up, the ceiling is glassed (think it was lvl 2 of the bakery) and u see the night sky. Very cozy :) 

Cons: 
- Its still a bit buggy at time. After the fix where you didnt need to deliver the goods it was better. Had only one bigger problem and it was when i left the packed and ready crate, clicked on the door to deliver it but it said that there was nothing there, i relogged and it all vanished. Had to start a new day. 
- Its a bit easy :) Maybe too easy. The progress is too fast. Id like to work for it more. Maybe its possible for the devs to make a hard mode where we dont level up so fast and need to earn more money to upgrade? No 5000 gold or dollars at the start either. That would be great :) 

Additional info:
- After 5h of playing im already on lvl 20. Im not sure how many more levels and upgrades there are but im guessing maybe 5-10 more. I think i saw a vid on yt where a guy finished it at lvl 30. I wish there was more. In games like this its not only the baking that is satisfying but also reaching new goals. 
- I wish there was possibility to sell my own goods directly at the bakery. To have an additional room where ppl could come in and i could sell what i baked early in the morning. I wish there was rush to prepare as much as possible to sell more and maybe be able to upgrade for more space. I mean there is a lot of potential for future expansions.

For now i will definitely recommend it. Just be prepared that its a small game where you will most likely achieve almost everything pretty fast.

I played Adventure quest 2D a lot as a child and have always had a soft spot for the game. So when I saw that there was a 3D version I was really excited, but that excitement didn't last long. This game has potential to be so much more, because where it's at right now it can draw attention to it when they're are far more better titles to be spending you time on. The game is a bit on the childish side. Which I do get why that is but I think they could implement a bit more grindy and tough to stuff so it can appeal more to players. Also must say there a far to many cut scenes when handing in or taking a quest.

Pros:

-Nostalgia
AQ 3D is great to play for a while for the nostalgia alone. I don't think there are alot of players playing this that didn't earlier play another version of AQ. 

Cons:

-Micro transactions
And also please remove the micro transactions in the game, or at least the ones to buy classes. Just have a small fee to play the game and im sure it would be a far engagement from players. Because where the game is at the moment you can pretty much pay your way to the top, where otherwise you'd have to grind boring quests for quite a while. 

-Quests
MMORPG are suppose to be grindy, and alot of the grinding is often repeating the same thing over and over. But AQ's quests are just overall pretty meh. What they do is they give lots and lots of quests that a really simple to complete. So it might take while to complete them all since there are so many of them but there is no challenge what so ever. Also, just get rid of the cutscenes, or at least lower the amount. When you get so many quests there is no reason for there being so much dialogue between them all. 

-Classes
Some of the beginning classes have lie on different attack. There is not much variation at all.

-Pvp
This game isn't worth looking into if your playing it for the PVP aspects. Evasion stat is way to op which leads to it being very boring and infuriating.

Conclusion:

Good game. 
You should try it for the nostalgia and to just explore the AQ world but in 3D.

The short of it? This sucks, dear God stay well away go play ESO or FF14 instead.
The long? Well here's some bullet points:
- The original tech demo for AQ3D was way WAY back in 2014. Which means at that point they had a playable build of the game and have been working at least an extra year on it beforehand. I'm making note of this because some reviews are saying ""Oh it only 'just' left Early Access so I'll go easy on it!"" when, no, this has been in development since 2013! Probably even earlier, who knows.
-Why did this have to be in 3D? I was expecting something akin to Runescape, you know, having tons of side activities that you can level up and really feel like you're living in the world itself. This is honest to God just AQWorlds but in 3D with zero changes.
-I don't think the developers know what they want to do. Infact I've seen developer streams where they openly mock how garbage the game is. On top of that, I swear every year they change the premise of the story. It's embarassing.
-No clue who their market is. Is it babies first MMO? No since there's too much payment shit (we'll get into that later). Is it an MMO for teens? No since the gameplay is far too simple. An MMO for adults? Nope, the writing is comparable to a Blues Clues episode. Because of this you'll experience horrendous mixed feelings throughout pretty much everything you do. I really can't explain it but it feels like you're playing Fortnite as a 20-something year old on the family TV while all your extended family are there. It feels cringey to play at all ages is what i'm getting at.
-The art is okay. The artists had to go from working in 2D Flash to modelling and texturing 3D models so I can't really blame the quality on account of this. That being said, outside of a few stand out environments and assets, this looks comparable to Wizard101 from 2008.
-MMO's are notorious for having grinds. Out of all of them i'd class AQWorlds as 'the' grindiest MMO of all time to such a point you feel compelled to bot out of necessity. So how does AQ3D alleviate this? By introducing more grinds of course! ""Go kill X amount of enemies"" is what 99.99% of the quests are like. AE if you're reading this please for the love of God hire a bloody game economist or playtest your questlines. This goes for AQW as well, in no corner of hell does anyone need to kill tens of thousands of enemies to complete a single quest (Legion Revenant). That's just stupid.
-""Oh you want that cool rare item?"" *dangles a bag of coins. ""How much you gonna pay for it?"". AQ3D is the playground bully of egregious MMO payments. You'll be reminded to buy currency or the upgrade at every waking step, every time you open a shop, every time you open the damn menu. Again, this goes for AQW as well so clearly the devs never learn't from their mistakes.
Overall just don't play this. You have no reason to and there's already several other free MMO's that are far more fun and do far more unique things than AQ3D ever will.",1667113426,1667113426,False,51,4,0.7827563881874084,1,False,False,False,True,,1667145331.0,"Thank you for taking the time to check out our game.

It means ""this game often frustrates me and I can't recommend it to new players, because you might feel those same frustrations and then hate it since you haven't been with it since day one"".

Maybe I'd call it unfinished, despite now being a 1.0, but I've gotten plenty of mileage out of SE, having played it on and off since its early days, and will most likely keep playing it unless it goes in a direction that some people are afraid of. The ingredients for something outstanding are all there, and unlike what some detractors might think, it's clear that thought and effort have gone into them. SE's unique Voxel deformation isn't just eye candy, but serves a practical function in identifying where your ship or building has taken damage. The building system doesn't give you many options in the form department as opposed to something like Avorion, but is solid when it comes to function, as your survival game is all about being an engineer - as the title implies - and devising solutions to solve the various problems you're faced with, such as streamlining your mining and logistics stream, optimizing production to ensure you'll have the materials you need to fulfill your building ambitions, or how to compartmentalize your ship to protect its crew from hull breaches.

The whole while, the game teases you with this sort of endgame of steamrolling your ship across the star system, crushing hapless AI pirates and plundering their remains, or the idea of a server with groups of players building their own interplanetary factions from the ground up and battling over resources. Unfortunately, due to technical issues with physics, performance, or multiplayer (after six years of attempts to fix them), and a general lack of features or the incompleteness of what's there, they just don't get put together in a way that lets this game meet its full potential.

The 1.0 feels less like a milestone and more like a letter of resignation. Like Keen just saying ""alright, we give up trying to wrangle the physics engine into doing what we need it to do and keeping performance stable, so here's some new features"". That's not a slight against the devs, I get where they're coming from. Their physics engine is clearly getting long in the tooth, and I don't think they could fix its limitations in ten years, let alone six. A 110m/s speed limit in space and randomly exploding rotors will just have to be an accepted inconvenience, I guess. However, some players are concerned that new features to flesh out the game will be come in the form of DLC, rather than updates. The first of these came in the form of ""decorative"" blocks, and additional cockpit variants. Granted, it cost four bucks, less than some cups of coffee where I'm from. Granted, it's all a bunch of non-functional blocks, save for the cockpits, and even then they just look different. Granted, the most dubious part - people without DLC being unable to interact with the blocks in multiplayer - would only be a problem if multiplayer was in any kind of playable state. And granted, the DLC was separate from the main update. However, it was taken as a bad sign, and some are worried that it might be the typically innocuous start of a trend.

Maybe the fear is unfounded. Maybe it'll be like when folks thought the game would become an Xbox One exclusive when the port was announced, or that it'd be abandoned in favor of Medieval Engineers when that was announced. Maybe someday we'll all look back on this and laugh at how silly we were being about it. Even still, that's not the issue. The issue is certain elements of the community, who can be found on the KSWH forums and Discord, who will call you an entitled ingrate for not wanting to embrace such an idea, should it come to pass. ""You have concerns about the pace of SE's development? Who are you to talk? What have [i]you[/i] ever made in your life?"" ""You think this feature feels incomplete? Well why don't you just dip into the source code and finish it yourself, you brat?"" ""Oh, you wouldn't pay 30usd retroactively for every update in the game's development? So you think you can get away with just paying 20 dollars in 2014 and expecting everything after that for [i]free?![/i] Uninstall the game, you cretin."" If I've ever had the misfortune of playing a game with a more egotistical, spiteful, and contemptuous lot, I can't remember it. Thankfully, as mentioned, multiplayer in Space Engineers is scarcely functional, so dealing with these people isn't required. However, any time I have the gall to check on the playerbase, I wish I could refund this game.

[b]In summary,[/b] SE is probably one of the best of its kind visually, and all the elements for something outstanding are there. Unfortunately, it suffers from technical issues that might be unfixable, unfinished features that might be kept behind a paywall, and an embarrassingly defensive player-base that will likely turn away anyone who values a community. If you're able to put up with those, and if our DLC-based fears aren't realized after all, you might be able to see why we've been sticking with it for so long despite so many frustrations. For some of us, the potential is still too enticing to completely let go of.",1554774033,1554774512,False,10,1,0.5507758855819702,1,True,False,False,False,,1554891990.0,"Hi, fifth smell.

A unique look is all you need to get me into a game, and Das Geisterschiff had me right from the start. I was doubly interested to then find it a turn-based dungeon crawler in the vein of classic Wizardry or Grimrock. The cyberpunk stylings were just icing on the cake, forming a trifecta I thought would be a total delight. And I was wrong, tragically wrong, because inside that cake is just a tiny bit of fluff. All the style in the world won’t save your game if nothing happens in it, and after hours of wandering empty halls searching for invisible items I’m ready to blame my boredom on exactly that.

Turns out the future isn’t full of grim darkness, it’s actually so bright the surface of the Earth has been scorched clean. Everyone who didn’t get an atomic sunburn moved the party underground, where two dystopian megacorps now lord over the remaining populace. I guess they got bored down there because they’re stuck in a forever war and you’ve joined up with one of them as a mech pilot, taking on odd jobs to stick it to The Man for your own The Man. Your assignments will send you to all sorts of subterranean cities, tunnels, and ruins in search of data to steal or agents to kill, hopefully without wearing down your mech or exhausting you of ammo before that happens.

In gameplay terms, you have a grid map to scoot around one turn at a time in search of your objectives. There are doors blocking your progress that you can open, shoot, or bash to get past, and less frequently you’ll find doors to new areas. Maps can be quite winding and confusing, especially with the simplified graphics and few unique features of hallways. Occasionally you’ll be accosted by an enemy, which you’ll take turns popping with your weapons and scooting towards or away from tactically. More often you’ll come across mines to avoid or disarm, or force fields you need to lower somehow. Beyond that, you’ll find wall terminals and random notes that flesh out the story of what you’re doing and how fucked the world you’re doing it in is.

Before you ask what the titular Geisterschiff is, I will confess that I can’t tell you because I couldn’t get past the second mission. Right from the tutorial and the first mission, the problems that eventually derailed my adventure were apparent. You might have picked up that levels are tough to navigate with few landmarks and many doors, but there’s also no proper map aside from your tiny 5×5 grid on the HUD. That makes it hard enough to find your way around, but the game is rife with fruitless dead ends often behind locked doors that you need to waste valuable ammo or hitpoints to open by bashing them with your face. You’ll need to find items like keys and upgrades but these are literally invisible, requiring you to step into every square on the map to know you’ve found everything.

Combat is probably the most interesting part of the game, and because of that also the most damning because it almost never happens. When an enemy approaches, you have the option to attack while advancing, retreating, or holding your ground. You also have four different weapons with different effects on both enemy behavior and damage. Switching and reloading them takes turns, though, so you have to plan ahead a little. The mobility factor allows you to duck around corners to escape or launch ambushes, though at my early stage of the game I mostly just had to shoot until dead. The issue, as I mentioned, was that combat was incredibly rare. I faced perhaps two or three foes in the first level and less than a dozen in the second, and over the course of two hours that’s not much time spent strategizing. The rest of the time was searching for invisible keycards and quest objectives, and that got old real fast.

The last big issue with Das Geisterschiff is how thin most of the game systems are. You have stats but no way to influence them except by picking up invisible upgrades off the beaten path for +2 to a stat. You can only repair yourself at workshops, and there’s no way to recover ammo, and that’s about all the purported “survival horror” elements amount to. There are no complex interactions in the game, and no puzzles more complex than “find key for barrier” or “complete quest by going to place”, which makes wandering the empty halls even more of a barren experience. There’s simply not enough to do here except explore samey levels in the hope of progressing and maybe getting to fight something.

This is one of those games I really set out to love, one that sounded like a fresh and exciting experience I had been looking for. I love the style, I love the premise, and I love the mash-up of genres. And it could have been great, but all the contents feel utterly half-baked. Even the striking art direction suffers from having no actual animations for anything and a weird smattering of languages confusing the signage and level names. Das Geisterschiff is a bold foundation for a game with a cardboard cutout built atop of it, a hollow experience that only the most patient and invested players will get anything out of. But for me, there are too many games out there that give me a giant mech AND something to do with it, and I’m going to stick to those.

＞ ...the game is rife with fruitless dead ends often behind locked doors that you need to waste valuable ammo or hitpoints to open by bashing them with your face.

Unless the door is/was rendered inoperable, you can open it later after getting a higher access level card. Just having an option to destroy the door to bypass keyhunting doesn't mean it's meant to be used on every step.

＞ You’ll need to find items like keys and upgrades but these are literally invisible, requiring you to step into every square on the map to know you’ve found everything.

Not true. Keycards are marked with a circle w/ oscillating color to attract one's attention even from a few tiles away. Locations of upgrades are marked by a nondescript box.

＞ You have stats but no way to influence them except by picking up invisible upgrades off the beaten path for +2 to a stat.

While it may appear that way on the surface, the combat tutorial mentions several cases where and how the stats are affected. It may look like a minor thing, but it's important to know this to survive in the long run.

This game sucks, but it's not obvious until it's too late to refund. I shall tell you why!

Basically the entire premise of the game is flawed - it costs you threat (a bad thing that accumulates and ends in defeat) to attempt a mission which you have no real guidance on beforehand. So you are paying a deadly price to go in blind with a 'drone' or drones you design. You don't get unlimited chances - you get threat with each attempt. This would be fine if sending down a 2nd drone picked up where the first wore off (so you'd pay a price but eventually be able to complete anything by chipping away at it) ----

But no. You restart fresh but in a worse position every time you fail a mission. You perhaps know what how to tweak your drone to better survive the mission but that's largely irrelevant because you only get to carry/use X parts which you have to pray to RNGesus you get in time for them to be useful. 

This results in extremely tedious missions which are sometimes impossible and it's down to pure luck if you get bent over by the procedural generation gods too many times and fail a play through. I got a snake mission in my first galaxy that was literally impossible to complete with the parts I had at the time - One of the eggs was buried in the middle of the planet. And I discover this after trying the mission 3 times and carefully flying around up and down and patiently waiting for the big snake to go away so I can chip away at an egg. These missions are extremely tedious.

In general the RNG is tuned to be *hard* on easy. I give you a 1/20 chance of it being possible to win an easy play-through, 1/100 for a normal, and impossible for hard. Unless you have lotto-like luck it's likely you'll end up failing a couple of missions and ending up with too much threat and nowhere to dump it. Ded.

Also, the instant you lose a part you might as well quit that play-through. Losing a part is (generally) crippling to the drone, which is fatal to the mission, which makes parts with independent (and tiny) hit-points pointless. You can drag it out as long as you like tho...

Don't waste your time. I haven't seen a game this fundamentally flawed since Sunless Sea.",1580192821,1580193070,False,2,0,0.4600219130516052,2,True,False,True,False,,1587982419.0,"Hi Xira

This game makes CPUs run HOT. Looking at my CPU core temps during gameplay, they went from ~50c to ~70c instantly, and climbed to ~90c over the course of several minutes, before crashing. So I probably have a cooling issue. I'll work on resolving that and see if it fixes the problem, then revisit this review once I can play more of the game. At this point I tentatively recommend WftO for people who meet the recommended specs AND have a really good cooling solution - my little case fans clearly aren't cutting it. /edit

I want to like War for the Overworld. I do. I probably could grow to like it, if it would let me play it. But between constant crashes and a gameplay style choice that just dosesn't work well for me, I'm left frustrated and disappointed. Sometimes you just can't go back to the way things were.

WftO has all the pieces to be a great spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper 2; one of my favorite games of all time. The voice acting is nostalgiariffic, and the UI tickles all the old neurons that have been left dormant since EA murdered the Dungeon Keeper franchise in its sleep, lo these many years ago. The dialogue is funny, the creatures are creative, the spells and traps make me feel just as evil and fiendish as their inspirations did in prior decades. That should be enough to put this game over the top, for me. But the devil's in the details.

I'm not a huge fan of the rushes in the campaign levels I've gotten to see, so far. This game seems to be a lot more about defending your half-built and shoddily repaired dungeon from increasingly dire and unavoidable enemy incursions than about actually building up your dungeon as you explore the level and probe the enemy's defenses. That might be good news for some fans, but it's not really what made DK2 fun for me, personally. There seems to be a lot less freedom in how you can tackle the campaign levels if you want to survive - which seems ironic, given the plethora of new options WftO gives to you. No matter what gadgets are at your disposal, you have to move fast, you have to focus on immediate survival over long-term planning, and you have to rush for whatever objective the stage gives you, over exploring. If that's how you already wanted to play, then great. But I miss the more methodical pace I remember from DK2.

But that's a minor complaint. I could get past it, and find a game I still enjoy, even with some caveats, if not for the fact that it crashes so much it's barely playable. I have restarted the fourth level four times, because the game simply refuses to remain functional long enough for me to beat it. I've had similar issues with other stages. Saving can be used to brute-force your way through a level while losing minimal amounts of progress over and over, but is that fun? If I have to restart, I want it to be because I lost, or because I want to try a new strategy, not because the game is so unstable I have to restart the game (or reboot my computer!) every 5 - 15 minutes.

Maybe I'm the only one with this problem. I can't imagine that after all this time, this degree of crashing is still a problem for eveyone who plays this game, or there's no way it'd have remotely positive reviews. But I can only speak from my own experience, and for me, the game is basically unplayable. I more than meet the recommended specs, for what it's worth.

I have waited so long (3+ years!) for WftO to become stable. But I honestly think it crashed less back in Early Access. I give up, for now. I'll let it simmer on the back burner of my library for another couple of years, I guess, and hope it's actually functional by the time I get back to it. In the meantime, I can't recommend it.",1470962235,1471250393,True,0,0,0.0,2,False,False,False,False,,1471023739.0,"Hi Nightsong81,

Thanks for the review and deepest apologies for the experience you've had with crashes.

These days we would expect crashes to be rather rare and only in exceptional circumstances should they occur in Gameplay. I'd love to help you resolve your issues and get you back in the game without crashes but to do so I'll need you to submit a a bug report on our [url=https://brightrockgames.userecho.com/]bug tracker[/url] following our [url=http://brightrockgames.userecho.com/topics/118-how-to-submit-a-bug-ticket/]guidelines[/url].

You can also find troubleshooting advice for various crashes in our [url=http://brightrockgames.userecho.com/topics/1094-general-crash-troubleshooting/]knowledge base[/url]

As soon as we've got information from you we'll do our best to identify the cause of your crashes and get you back in the game as soon as possible! Don't rely on time to deploy fixes as without good reports we can't identify the cause in specific cases!

With regards to the ""rushyness"" of the original campaign, we definitely took a lot of feedback on board for Heart of Gold and we looked to making that campaign more open, pleasantly paced and methodical for our players. Once we've got you back up and running you might find that to your liking.

Cheers,

----

Picked this back up today and pleased to say a lot of my original issues have been resolved, so going to cover what's been fixed, and what still needs work (imo).

Frame-rate is now solid, not sure if it's my new rig (similar spec to the old one) or if the game has been optimised. But it no longer skips frames, and seems to hold up okay even on large playsets.

Physics are much better, when you throw lots of track pieces on top of each other, you are now able to pick an individual piece up and place it. When placing tracks it also doesn't bodge up existing track and disconnect random pieces you already had setup. It only seems to change existing track in order to complete the circuit which is spot on. So the issues I ran into before are gone, woot! 

Menu is still comedy size, I could understand if this was done for folks using older headsets with low resolutions but a setting to configure the distance from face would be great, as I'd like it a couple of feet further back so it doesn't consume my entire FOV.

Spent around 30 minutes just tinkering and found it a fun and relaxing experience. I couldn't figure out how to get the big red button track working, I sussed out how to connect it by dragging, but even when it was connected to a switchable track piece i couldn't figure out how to actually 'press' it, pressing the action button again just lets me wire it up to more things.

Going to change review to a recommendation.

Thanks!


Original review
-----

Loved the concept but found the execution too frustrating. 

The (new) physics are highly temperamental, sometimes I'll be slotting track pieces together with no probems. But occasionally it'll decide to become the dark souls of train games and everytime I slot a new piece of track in, it moves and disconnects the previous piece; making it impossible for me to ever make a completed circuit. 

I suspect it's trying to be helpful, and applying some degree of magetism to snap near-by parts together. But this has little regard for if the piece is already connected to something else or not. This also means if you throw a load of parts onto the ground at once to save going into the comedy-size menu, the parts all get a life of their own and refuse to be picked up.

My other complaint is the frame-rate. I have a pretty decent VR rig but for some reason this game just murders my graphics card. Even when you start a new game where it's just an empty void of nothing-ness the frame-rate will jump from 90fps to mid 20's then back up again without any explaination. I'm used to some Unity jank with my VR titles, but can't fathom why it's jumping around when there isn't a single track on the ground.

So suggestions to the developer would be:

- The menu is huge and clumbersome, it put imax cinemas to shame. Having to constantly open and close it because it takes up so much of my field of vision is very annoying. Please let me move it further away (holding the menu button then up/down on the sticks) and also have the menu button toggle it on and off, so I don't have to cramp my neck just to see and hit the close button.

- Sort out the physics, probably easier said than done, but having it moving and snap-completing pieces of track i've already put down is really annoying. Only the piece (or pieces) I'm holding should snap complete.

- Framerate, feel like there is something fundmentlly wrong/buggy here causing it to jump around so much regardless of if anything has even been built or on-screen.

About new physics: they are related to trains, we think your complaint is about the track snap system. We have tested the game with lots of extremely complex networks and never had a problem closing them since v1.3. Sometimes closing a circuit is a small puzzle challenge, but that is part of the fun of this game.

About frame rate: perhaps it is a problem with your system. Can you tell us which VR set you have? We have a computer with Oculus and a not-so-decent hardware (Oculus app even warns about our hardware doesn’t meet minimum requirements), but the game works flawlessly and at a decent framerate. We have tested it with a profiler, and the framerate seems ok. We are concerned about performance for a pleasant VR experience, and we made a lot of testing and put a lot of work and effort on this matter.

Let’s agree to disagree about the size of the menu :) . The menu can be moved holding the menu button. It is pretty easy and straightforward to get rid of it at any moment. The menu is designed to be easy to navigate and pick pieces as the game is designed for all range of ages, even 4 years old children can use it (we have tested it).

Of course we have a lot to improve, it’s a work-in-progress and we’re making changes hearing the community’s proposals. 

Cut us some slack and we hope you reconsider your review for future versions.",763790

But for any thing other than that I would say don't waste your money. At the time of writing this the latest patch ""Improves the AI's 'self preservation'"". Does it really? 

First my workers ignored the ""high prioity"" set metal prossers with 3 ore a piece in them to make the steel needed to make more spare parts. When they finaly made the parts to fix the power producers.
I just watched as 3 wind turbines fail in the middle of the night 2 seconds before a sandstom (which could have changed the entire outcome if at least one had been fixed). The ""AI*"" right before that decided the solar pannals that where NOT EVEN BEING USED AT THE TIME where more of a prioity to repair.
This FAIL in proper ""AI*"" priorization caused all power to be lost and the O2 levels droped to zero killing every one.

The ""AI*"" in this game is a joke. The only way I could see this game is ""What happens when the dumbest idiots try to populate a new planet"".

Edit: After further game time the above still stands but with an exception. There is no build queue for the colonists (at least at the moment) so you are forced to build one thing at a time. Or it can end up being the total death of your settlement. If you like to place a bunch of buildings all at once, then you must have the resources to build them all at once. The AI in this game will try to build every structure at once. Unlike in some other 'city builder' games, where the AI focuses on constructing the set buildings in the order they are placed.

At the current time of writing this, that function is not in play. Though if you (the reader) can use the 'work around' and/or don't mind that 'rule', the game might be for you.

Misleading. Graphics are not at all like the trailer.Also you need to PAY for all you see on the trailer,PLUS DLC since armor,planes,weapons,soldiers etc are pay-to-play.PLUS DLC.  First thing i realize upon playing is that there is no configuration menu. i mean, there IS one but it ONLY lets you choose the display at what resolution. Nothing else.

Second,i can't configure controls. I can't configure anything.No menu for it either.

I tried joining games, but there is NEVER enough players to begin a game. I need to play offline to even try the game out. And even that is screwed up because i discovered that, since i can't set aforementionned controls, i can't go prone behind fox holes(Said holes only being knee-deep).Or do anything! Can't even spawn bots to train or even try out the game's core concept!

Third: I do not believe one bit that there was 18 years of ACTIVE development on this game. If this game came out in 2001,then had 18 years of development,it's more than certain the game should be WAY better than this. Sound design would be better,models would not look like a playstation 2 game (Polygonal limitations of the console.No more excuses with even BASIC super cheap Integrated GPU's in processors of the last 5 years,nowadays IGPu's letting you play 1080p 60 fps in a lot of A-class games (CS:GO,Fortnite/PUBG,Overwatch even,etc.)). There is NO excuses on anything hardware-related.

And when it comes to grapical design... this game is LEGITIMATELY low quality in all it's aspects. no water(Or at least barely from gameplay footage i went to see to compensate for no players playing),barely any landscaping done,animations are really low quality,etc. you get it. If it's gonna appeal to 2019 players, it needs a serious workout.

There is not way in hell anyone would pay a SUBSCRIPTION for 15$ ***PER MONTH*** for a game like this. This game feels like a cash grab. With all the money they would have collected over 18 years from it's player base,considering it was never really free, they should have had the money to actually make the game WAY better than it is as of right now.

Good thing this game had free-access this month. Not worth the money investment,with all those EA-style cash grabbing schemes.I mean heck,even EA,***the company that abuses the shit out of DLC*** doesn't have 3/4 of it's game locked behind DLC! EVEN EA! I can't believe i'm saying that!

Anyway,game scores on metacritic are bs,subscription-based game ***with pay to play*** on top of it, WITH DLC on top of it is just the worst,and on top of that there is no player base with misleading trailer(Trailer shows stuff you need to PAY for,along with content you will never get to see in-game anyway due to before mentionned lack of players),and just so much more stuff that i just can't get into words.

If this game is to even be CONSIDERED to be sold/bought to/by ANYONE, it needs to stop the ***15$*** per month subscription (20$ per month for the ""Premium"" stuff),not make any excuses about hardware (SPECIALLY not in 2019,now that even low-spec computers can run A-class games easily),and actually put some heart in the development. And if budget allows it,get some graphics improvements. In 2019 a game that looks like this is not appealing to the public. And also, actually putting a graphical/audio/controller/keyboard setup menu is MANDATORY for ANY game. No excuses.


Will not play the game anymore. Nor think i will ever play it in the future if it keeps heading that way.

I therefore want to update my review!

*The issue with the Lord's Manor and gold stocks has been resolved.  The game now has built-in early-game quests that lead you in a very natural progression to learn the game and set up your early economy.  The Lord's Manor is now one of the easiest buildings to unlock, and so the loss of gold is not an issue.  Also, there are a wide variety of quests and special events with varied benefits and negatives.

*There are now a number of helpful tools in the UI for managing villagers, which mostly eliminates the need for directly selecting them.  Villagers also will shift between houses on their own to optimize distance from their workplace/market/well/church, eliminating the issue where they would just build a house wherever there was room, and then be perpetually angry because it would take them all day to walk to work and back.

*Because of the way the game has evolved, having to click the X to close building menus is more of a benefit than a problem now.  It's often helpful to have multiple buildings open at once.

*Trade feels a little more natural now, including trade boons for completing quests helping that faction.  Still kind of wish for resources to be a bit more map-specific, but the game is so beautiful and streamlined and fun, I feel guilty even saying it.  Leaving my original post and first Edit up so you can see the progression as the game has evolved.

Overall, this game is one of the most fun and addictive I've played in recent years.  I had been craving a game with free-form building, and I took the chance on this one...and I was not disappointed!  If you enjoy free-form building (like the settlement-building in Fallout 4) you will not be disappointed.  If you're looking for a Medieval combat simulation with building as a central mechanic, this is not the game for you.  The most combat you get in this game is sending soldiers off to help defend the kingdom in exchange for money and land.

The game is still in development, so there are still some clunky elements--your villagers start to get stuck on building elements and each other once things get crowded, there are still some place-holder text lines, and that sort of thing.  But the game is beautiful, the monuments with their sticky elements are very user-friendly, and once you get the hang of the interface, the game is very easy to learn.

Now some details.

Things I love:
The overall concept is incredible.  There is something immensely satisfying about the way the villagers build their own housing.  The combination of free-form building and painted districting overlays is brilliant.  The villager animations are adorable.  Designing the monuments--especially later in the game when you have lots of component options--is very fun.  The difference between monuments and public buildings, which are unlocked by beautifying your city/gaining influence with a power faction and upgrading your villagers respectively, is a clever game mechanic.  The basic concepts of the game are similar to games like Age of Empires, where you build resource collecting buildings and assign villagers to that resource, which is very intuitive.  It's just a relaxing, immensely satisfying game.

Things I wish were different:
*You are limited to 500 gold at the beginning of the game, and it is only by unlocking the Lord's Manor that you gain the ability to raise your maximum capacity--a relatively difficult monument to unlock.  Meanwhile, the Wooden Keep is an early-unlock monument that opens up combat quests which give a 1000 gold reward.  The extra gold is lost, which in a game where your gold reserves fluctuate wildly, can be quite frustrating.  I wish there were either no limit, or a 1000 gold limit to start.
*Selecting villagers is very difficult as they are always moving, and you can't click-drag a select box to catch one or more.  This is alleviated somewhat by being able to assign idle villagers to buildings directly at the building, but there is still no way to assign Builders without clicking a villager directly.  I wish there were a population management screen where you could make villager assignments and track your population's needs and happiness.
*Selecting buildings opens up a very helpful window, but the only way to close it is by clicking an X.  I wish you could close the window by either right-clicking or by selecting the building again.
*The trade mechanic is relatively simple to learn, but it is currently highly tiered and immutable.  Trading refined resources is part of the economy built into the game, but I wish the resources you were able to trade was either randomized or variable, so that playing the game didn't feel like a trial and error experiment in learning which buildings to build in which order, but one in which you had to react to the resources you have available.
*I enjoy the quests, but there are only a few that keep popping up; many of which aren't possible to complete.  I look forward to more being available.

All in all, it's already a good game, if you're looking for what it has to offer.  I was, and it was the best game purchase I've made in ages!  But it's definitely obvious that it's a work in progress.  I can't wait to see what the end product will be!

Update:
I have now played the game for some 14 hours.  I take back some of my wishes--unlocking the Lord's Manor is not so hard as I had thought, once you learn the game, and having large quantities of gold is not nearly so useful as having large quantities of trade goods to sell to your villagers or other towns.  After spending more time with the game, I think making the trade mechanic more complex would make the game nearly impossible to play--you need to be able to sell certain goods and buy others in order to make the town viable.

I do think it's a worthwhile thought that perhaps the kinds of goods you can produce should depend on the terrain type chosen at the outset.  Like maybe wine and sheep for mountainous regions, grain and honey for the river, fish and dyes for the coast, etc.  And then the trade cities (and goods available/desired for trade) should be different depending on the terrain.  It felt weird growing grain essentially on a beach, and that I was well into the mid-game before I was able to build a fisherman's hut.  BUT, these are minor complaints/suggestions.  Still a freaking amazing game, the more I play it the more I love it.  It truly fills me with joy every time I open it up.",1549738502,1593795482,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,True,False,,,,690830

[b]Management:[/b] You are tasked with assigning jobs to your teammates during the mission loadout to help accomplish more over the course of the game.

[b]Shooter:[/b] You can't hipfire, and only shoot once by holding down right mouse, then pressing left. It is only ADS shooting.

[b]Exploration:[/b] The areas are small, and while you are free to explore what you want, radiation hot zones railroad an experience for you to play though. You can however choose what mission to do when, whenever you want.

[b]Music:[/b] Great, really on the right path for what is expected in this survival game. 

[b]Voice Acting:[/b] Only in Russian, that isn't the problem the problem is the quality of it, there doesn't seem to be tension during the dialogue parts, and sounds like people reading a script. 

[b]Dialogue:[/b] Branching, maybe? The multiple roads all seem to end at the same outcome.

[b]Movement:[/b] It felt very chunky

[b]Optimization:[/b] Running the game on low settings, i maxed out at 7fps in a majority of parts, making the game unplayable, despite meeting all the system requirements above minimum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Edit for Developer Response 17 Oct:[/b]
@Legileg I ran it on Low Settings on the following hardware:
GPU: ASUS GeForce GTX 970 STRIX
CPU: Intel Core i5-4460 Haswell Quad-Core 3.2
Ram: 24GB (2x8GB | 2x4GB) DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600
where the minimum requirements were
GPU: Geforce GTX 760 / GTX 1050
CPU: Intel Core i5-2500K CPU
Memory: 8 GB RAM

I was unable to complete the Moscow Eye mission to due to frame dropping down to 7 during the majority of exploration. The lowest I dropped was during the Moscow Eye mission, inside the room with the projector, and the area around it, where they dropped to the point where the game was unplayable (5fps). I tried to exit the area, but the chugging continued to follow me. Even during the CNPP initial raid, i was getting around 10fps-15fps. I managed to get above 90fps inside the refuge map area and while inside the ""portal dimension"" 

When i mentioned the movement felt chunky, I meant that when I move the mouse, the player tends to float with momentum, it feels that the turning follows behind the mouse itself and is slightly delayed when not aiming down sights and not a 1:1 movement ratio.

My second biggest issue was the fact you can't hipfire, which felt like a nitpicky problem, especially in tense situations, when i had a shadow after me, It killed the atmosphere having to stop, aim, then as the creature attacked me, continue to aim then fire. A tense atmosphere would have been kept if  i was able to hipfire while backing up without aiming down sights with a major accuracy decrease. 

While this game is a unique and hopeful experience, I had to return it because in its current state, and use the money for a different game, due to the fps drop making it unplayable for me. I hope as updates come out that issue will be fixed, and I will purchase and try again.",1571287521,1571330314,False,117,19,0.6971411705017089,12,True,False,True,False,,1571314025.0,"I understand that your biggest problem is movement and optimization, right?

Decided to give this another whirl 3 years after its been collecting dust in my library.

After that amount of time, I can safely say...

Still save your money for something else.

After starting a new game to give it the best possible chance, the amount of visual glitches that should be easily caught during testing, especially since this supposedly received more polish, tells me that the bare minimum was done. AI glitches started popping up with enemies deciding that 0.5 seconds is the appropriate amount of time to search something breaking near them before giving up.

...and with that, the immersion is broken. Why should I invest more time in a game that was buggy before to see if its less buggy 3 years later to figure out the story? In a post pandemic world, games are a good bit of escapism...but if they start frustrating early on, why invest more energy in them when there are toooooons of other games that do not.


ORIGINAL TEXT 2018:
Unless theres a huge patch fixing the bugs, streamling the quests and story, and fixing the pointless huge but empty maps, this ""released"" game feels like a half baked beta. Basic concept wise this game should be a smash hit. And yes the ""mostly positive"" is relying on the prerelease good mojo which is highly deceptive. 

But back to the game...you liked Bioshock right? Liked stealth heavy games that had combat when you really screwed up like Dishonored? Like a visually compelling area where theres actually something sinister going on? Sounds like those elements combined should be pretty awesome right? They would if there had been proper polish on stealth, game mechanics, a map that feels alive rather than sparsely populated, AI that behaves as expected, targetting of items for selection in the world as expected, and a quest system that is clear.

Case in point I was curious if foodpoisoning was a chance like the tooltip indicated or guarenteed...so I ate spoiled food. First one made me queasy, second made me sick, the third started some sort of ""fatal"" counter which the specifics were not exactly know how to buy time....and made mention of the 2 items Id need to cure myself in time. One of them sounded like an item that might exist in areas later in the game, it sounded fancy compared to the junk i was picking up...the other was some form of tea....except it didnt give me the recipe. What it did do was give me a quest, not display progress on it, and not make it apparent that I get the recipe from the quest that was autogenerated while I was puking. I barely managed to get things together in time with maybe 5% health left.

I then later recieved the recipe again randomly after a cutscene....and commented on it like it was the first time I had recieved it.

Its small things like this that are all too common. Good idea for game, bad execution.

TL;DR:
Is the game playable? Yes
Is it fun with all these issues? No
Is it worth the price of a AAA game right now? Absolutely not


Addendum: Continued to play further in. Just got progressively less engaging and interesting. Bugs (with perks and quests) and AI issues can be summed up as huge things on the agenda. Can the game be salvaged? Yes, to passable. Can this game be made into an awesome game? Conceptually yes...it could. But the time to do that was during the years in development....not at release. Large companies can handle a botched release of a game and pull out all the stops including re-releasing it. Compulsion Games? Not so much. 

I really try to find positives no matter how much negativity about one aspect of a game gets. I really do. And I really wish they fix this to be the game that was imagined. But as it stands [currently], I find minimal value in We Happy Few. It had cool lofty ideas and just cannot deliver.

It has a lot of potential, however, so if you like simple MMOs, you might want to go claim a nice name or something. I also note that I have never played any prior AdventureQuest games but have played multiple MMORPGs. As of this review, my character was level 5.

AdventureQuest 3D is a very basic MMORPG. I can't stress that out enough right now. From character creation to combat, most features are very barren and unnoteworthy as of the current version. Limitation is a word that comes to mind, and it is probably due to the game itself only being at its beta stage. Customization has few options, and there are only three (or four, if including the paid-for class) classes the player has to choose from, all of which are primarily DPS-based. 

Honestly, I believe that the combat is what really gets to me in this game. It's boring, and when put together with the general MMORPG aspect of grinding being required, gets very grating. There just doesn't appear to be much challenge. All classes have four moves and a quick autoattack, and most opponents are quickly taken down with them. Teamwork is nearly nonexistant, being basically just slaying monsters together by coincidence with little communcation. There are so many people online, and it is a shame that there isn't any encouraging to work together early on. As far as I am aware, there is not even a party system-- but I could be wrong. Strategy, unfortunately, doesn't seem to be a highlight as of now.

Maps are small and host a few number of unique mobs. Prepare to slay the same monsters 30 times each... with your same 4 moves... maybe with one random person who happens to be nearby. While crafting does prove to be an incentive (making a cardboard crown made me very happy), it is undeniable that it gets repetitive. There's a lack of a feeling of reward that some other games manage to capture, probably because of the grind beginning so early on. The size of the maps only add on to this feeling of repitition: there's little to see, other than the unfriendly neighborhood mobs. I like their designs, really, but after seeing the same faces over and over, that sense of wonder becomes exhausted.

Despite this, the game does have character. I enjoy the cutscenes and the personalities of the many NPCs, which seem highly self aware. It's funny! Descriptions for items often have humorous jokes in them. 

Still, I just don't think that it has enough to keep me playing for long.

However, as said before, the game is in its beta stage. Wandering around the central town, there are plenty of unopened shops for honestly interesting features to come, like pets and housing. The creators of the game, from what I can tell, do want to hear feedback, which is a good sign. And perhaps if you're more willing than I am to play around, you could help improve the game with your own suggestions. It has potential--- but right now, AdventureQuest 3D just feels too bare-bones for me.

So, if you really want to try this game, go ahead. I don't think most players will become heavily invested in it like with other games, but it's worth a brief try, if maybe for a few minutes. And who knows what the future holds for this game- it's probably good things!",1478623568,1480345978,False,2,0,0.4958677589893341,0,False,False,True,False,,1519759751.0,Hello!

2. Practically endless galaxy to explore.

Knut's work is easily recognizable in a lot of the environment and puzzles. There are also some fun non-Knut-like contributions to be spotted in both the environment and the game-play (e.g. little monsters, scary sounds in the cemetery).

Lisssn is a lot smaller than a typical Rhem game. Also, a map of the entire game is included from the very start. The puzzles can be divided into logical, item collecting, and musical. There is no story.

The idea for this game is great : learning something about music. The music puzzles were great fun, and took me back to evenings spent at the music school as a child. I think that for me, if the game would have focused even more on music/sound/rhythm/history, I would have liked it even better.  

The only negative : I have spent over 20 hours in the game, but I haven't finished it; 2 cards are missing from my inventory.
I will definitely replay this game in the future (once I have forgotten most of the puzzles).

The game is mostly about exploring procedurally genereated systems and planets.  This leads to a MOSTLY stale and boring experiance - as opposed to handcrafted worlds.

Please reached out to our support@leagueofgeeks.com and you can submit a bug report in-game during the prologue using the cog symbol in the top left corner.

One thing to try is switching the game into off-line mode and if that works then it helps us isolate what might be causing your crash.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the stability and performance of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development in out two-man code team spent patching it up. 

As an early access supporter, you even have the first expansion for free, and the second expansion was free for everyone! 

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

Patient Zero getting stuck on your fences should have been resolved and if your running into i i would recommend you contact us on Discord/Steam so we can get your save file and see the exacts. For Chelsey to be 3500 DNA you must be playing on experimental. Experimental is not for official full play as we are testing a lot of things on there at any given time.  

Shreader round are NOT 3500 on the stock game and will be patched to a much lower number next experimental build.....  We are testing on experimental with our community to find the right number.

There are also side quests and story quests which involve choices that impact the game, also action & stealth quests which are quite cool. you can also do side hustles trading or be corrupt and sell contraband if you like.

Have not had any bugs yet in 24 hrs of playing & the game does have a decent story going with cool quests.
pros - good solid game with no bugs
          lots to do and keep you entertained
          FPS combat inst bad reminds of stalker.
Cons - not really bad cons tbh
           Graphics are fair not horrible at all, on par with garage sim perhaps a bit better.
           No save function the game auto saves only at the end of the day when you go to sleep or you can 
           restart the day

Games worth the money, if i had to make a suggestion it would be allowing to save so if you need to quit the game you don't lose progress if you haven't finished the day yet.

In Planetbase the AI follows some simple rules, that (hopefully) should be easy to understand: the first tend to their needs: food, drink sleep, morale, then they do work, if they can (all the components, resources are there etc...)

The idea behind the game is that once you understand their behaviour you should be able to indirectly manipulate them, to do what you want, just like you would do in real life if you were managing a bunch of people.

We understand that this kind of gameplay is not to everyone's liking, and some people would prefer more micromanagement, but we wanted to try something a bit different in terms of gameplay for this game.

I'm sorry you're having an issue with your transmitter. The Turnigy i6 is a supported and confirmed transmitter for the sim, so let me see if I can't help get you going.

To start, from the main screen go to Settings, then Add+Remove Controller. Then select your transmitter's profile and delete it. Then quit the sim, and start it up again. Then try to recalibrate your transmitter following the instructions found at this link:

https://drlracingsimulator.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001150792-FlySky-Turnigy-i6-AFHDS-6CH

When the sim asks if you want to calibrate the switches, skip that, and complete your setup normally.

Run the sim and let me know the results, please. You can respond here, or if you're still having issues, send me an email here: joey@thedroneracingleague.com

Come join us on Steam, you will get free currency!! <-- This is a complete trap, considering they just delete the servers whenever they want, and all your gold and time go with it, no word no nothing. Just donate again right?

We waited all day Tuseday October 24th for some simple service from them, yet they gave us nothing and let us sit there unknowing to what happened and why this happened, I am sure many others are in the same exact boat, considering they couldn't even handle a 22-man server, and they offer 100-man servers. 

- Game was amazing when I was able to play it.
- Lots to offer
- Zero Steam Support
- Zero Cares for its population
- No backing for their own Promotions, they lure you in, and burn you out.

So I jumped in with very little clue what I was doing, the tutorial covered the very basics of sustaining a base, but nothing else. I thought this would be a problem, but I found with the tool tips and descriptions as well as the liner unlocking of buildings helped. 

My first 4 times playing were straight up failures one failure took me 4 hours of gameplay before everything just went wrong, I probably could have saved it. but I was so frustated I just turned off the air, until there was silence. after a couple tries I don't see how the gameplay would get old quickly, so many things can change the entire pace and direction of the game. the decisions you have to make are meaningful in the present future and very long term. 

some of the things I love,
the graphics,
the random terrian
the minimalist UI
and the AI works under most conditions.

some of the things I don't like/think should be improved
The UI, I apprecaite that there are not tons of menues and screens always on and in my face, but putting everything in one corner. some things I think should be outside of the submenues, like the security setting, when you need to change to yellow or red alert, going to the menu clocking managment options and then clicking secerity and then going to the pop up in the middle of the screen and selection which alert you want to set, feels way slow. 

On the topic of UI I would like to see better statistical information, and predictive information like how much food you need for a civilian a day, and compare that with your storage, and beyond anything that is a convince like that I would really like to see more information about your storage, and people. 

I don't feel like im in charge, but instead I am doing things and they are reacting, and sometimes in a way that I don't like or in certain cases in a way that they kill themselves...

There is no way to force a person to do a thing, if your colony is failing, it is extreemly hard to fix, as without being able to force one or two of your people to do one thing before anything else, they will make small problems worse, during food shortages ive noticed not so hungry people eating while someone is starving and never can walk to the food in time to get any(in that case though they did make it).

the priorty system is meant to fix the above problem, but it does not work all the time, in my expirence it works if everything is running smooth, but if all your people are tierd, hungry, thirsty, sick I have never seen them do what I marked as priority but instead do the least important things, like carry supplies to storage, when I could really use the medic to be making medical supplies in the machine that has all the reqired materials in it and is 70% done. 

I still would say the AI is good, Ive never seen pathing issues or anyone getting stuck, if they are not doing anything there is a reson why, even if its stupid like they are tierd or where hit by an metor. 

The game is fun, every decision matters and I cant count the amount of times where one night the wind did not blow and power went out, keeping the situation under control with your hands behind your back(becuase lack of control) is really fufilling when you succsed.

Please make sure the game runs on the GPU and not the Processor, sometimes it does not get recognized as a game and laptops run it on the CPU.
Also update your Nvidia drivers, old drivers can also cause crashes and fps problems.

If this did not help, please send me your logfile so I can analyze the problem!

We're always looking for ways to improve the performance of the game, however we would expect the majority of players to have no issues with completing the game without serious performance issues.

This could indicate you've run into a very specific issue and we'd like to look into it just to make sure whether there is in fact something very out of place.

Oh, and another thing, some of these puzzles are really dumb. i had no idea i had to right click on the junk after getting the quest to find glass to look for it, so it was a wild goose chase until i happened to find the solution. two words.

 When i first played this game, i thought it was really nice but little things to do, i got a bit inactive on the game once i reached the max level cap at the time when Ashfall Part II released (Level 18). I did get in recently when the game got a few redesigns and it looked awesome, i just logged in today and i was really excited to see so many things to do, i'll be definitely playing this game more now that there's more quests and places to go. Overall its great to see the evolution of AE's games from time to time and a pleasure to be part of the community and see the huge improvements you guys make every single day and a real honor to have your games' as part of my childhood. Hopefully everything works out for you guys here on Steam once AQW for Unity hits!

[h3]GAMEPLAY [/h3]
🔵Run your own Bakery, order ingredients, agree contracts, Bake & Deliver before Time Runs Out!
🔵Manage finances, resources, upgrades and expansions.
🔵Unlock new equipment, vehicles and recipes by increasing your client relationship.
🔵The game gets progressively more complex and time sensitive.
🔵Roadblocks hinder you when driving.
🔵You do have BOOSTS to help bake things quicker.
🔵Upgrading the premises and the machines really help you to bake a lot more produce.

[h3]POSITIVES [/h3]
✔️Reasonable price.
✔️Challenging.
✔️Looks Great & the food looks good enough to eat.
✔️UI + Interface is excellent.
✔️The game is a LOT OF FUN for all ages and genders.
✔️A nice collection of modules for progression, upgrade and expansion.
✔️Easy to learn, tough to master (especially with the bugs I encountered lol).
✔️This game delivers a wonderful dose of feel good factor.

[h3]NEGATIVES[/h3]
❌BUGS in BETA (pre-release) def did hinder my progress (I still really enjoyed playing)
❌Sometimes clicking and placement is a bit off (minor irritation).
❌Not really a simulator...They could do so much more with this game IMHO.
❌The driving is really basic and underdeveloped, again so much more could be done.

[h3]STAR FEATURES[/h3]
⭐Graphically the game is really pleasing & there are hours of fun to be had in this game.

[h3]RECOMMENDATIONS[/h3]
💡Bit more realism for me....Washing up, items I buy don't vanish each morning etc... Otherwise really fun.

Im sorry to see you are unhappy with the fact that the sim requires an internet connection. However I can see that you have hundreds of hours enjoying the sim, and the Steam store page states that the sim requires an internet connection. So I'm curious why the change of heart and where this frustration is coming from. We would love to help you troubleshoot any issue you may be having, or even if you'd just like someone to chat with, or even fly with in the sim. We're here for you either way. 

Send me a message, I've sent you a friend request, perhaps we can get to the bottom of your issues and see you with a smile on your face again. 

Thanks so much for your support! Looking forward to flying with ya!

Also I wanted to get most of the game's content before writing this, but you have to farm a lot with the little content before getting the rest.
Neon Abyss, is a rogue-lite(Kill stuff, loot stuff and get rekt) but some gameplay decisions are curious.
First, the game handles the rogue-lite stuff pretty well, you don't have to rely much on RNG, you can still get ressources with various tools, all weapons are beyond broken as long as you get items, so git gud and you're good to go.
Then the game replayability is okay, you often see the same room patterns early in the game, but you'll get to see more later on the game by unlocking the game's features.

So yeah, it's pretty fun on that part but...
Enemy variety is pretty low, at least, for the first 20 hours, I think I managed to see something 70% of the enemy pool, but it's often the same thing, small flying melee, big flying melee, flying ranged, flying ""minelayer"", ""slimes"", crabs and etc...
They differ a little, but they only get  variants, like, weaker, stronger, has contact damage and etc... But mostly, it's the same enemies.
The issue is not really this, but it's the very same encounters from Level 1 to 9. You don't feel like really progressing.
The enemies are not themed, it feels like the same level over and over, but it gets harder and harder.
Also, everything deals one half of damage, but when you get to the level 5 everything deals 1 full heart of damage including your bombs or evironment, there's nothing with varying damage, like, an elite doing more damage, or something.

Following this, the game is punishing, not like you would expect.
Enemies are spawning instantly, without any visible warning, I mean, they spawn like this, and immediatly attack you, or worse, you'll get an enemy with contact damage spawning ON you. It doesn't feel fair, you get damaged for no reason, and it's just feel frustrating like another enemy who throws grenades while trying to teleport on you without telegraphs. Especially when you try to get a wisdom portal.

The game pace is ... well, I can't tell if it's really bad or not.
What I mean by pace, is how fast you get to see new content, spoiler alert, It's really slow, the game feels short, and the unlockables feels little, you have to defeat 5 bosses to get a single item, and that's only for the first branch, and it gets longer and longer. Yes it does add longetivity to the game, but it doesn't feel that rewarding, because the default item pool and room presets are really small.
Well I guess it's a little bad after all.

And then that depends on the person, but you get overpowered really fast and easily, most items are items that improve your guns and add stats (damage, RoF, Range, Multishot...), so even your starting weapon can be Godlike. Bosses feel like ads, and they are not really impactful, but Hal and Argus, who feels like bosses but are still weak because of itemization.

Despite all of this, I think the game is cool, pretty and colorful, and I will continue the game, BUT I don't recomend it, unless you are patient, because alot of things are frutrating, but if you manage to get past that you'll get well rewarded with an overpowered caracter and a succesful run.

Thanks for taking the time to make a review, sorry you've had a mixed time!

We have dropped the 1.2 content patch which from some of your gripes adds teleportation symbols where teleporting enemies come in, plus when you enter the room it shows you where the monsters spawn.

On our experimental branch where you can test things early, we've also detached the power key from the melee key which should help.

There's lots more improvements, including to boss HP and weapon balance, plus loads of additions like new enemies, boss, rooms and much more in both live and experimental.

The aesthetic is very nice, quite dated graphics but because it's cartoonish its charming instead of ugly.

It seems very F2P friendly, nothing seems to be locked behind paywalls except cosmetics. This is a big plus. 

Where it sucks, depth and gameplay. The questing is still generic 'Kill Wolves', 'run over to the tree and 'Click on the tree'. There is literally no other quest type, seriously. No attempts at making puzzles or different experiences, just killing and clicking over and over.

The ability system its very accessible for mobile which is good, but again its terrible for PC. You have 3 skills, 1 'ultimate' and 1 cross skill. Cross skill cooldowns tend to be 30 seconds and the ultimate isn't something you think about other than 'click once its ready' so what this means is you spend 90% of combat pressing the same 3 skills. For classes like Warrior this means whatever is on cooldown.

I see with classes like Rogue they tried to add micromanagement to the barebones skill system. Its a good try but again the 3 skills format is too limited. Once I unlocked the cross skill (which is supposed to be shared? But for some reason looks designed like its only usable for Rogues) which seems in design to essentially be the 4th skill of the class, it felt alot more complete. I feel like even 1 extra skill for every class would have gone a long way to improving the feeling of complexity

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics in this game are great, pretty much the kinds of graphics you would expect with a space themed game. Nebulas look amazing, lighting effects are great, stars in the distant are as you would expect them, everything is in the right place graphically. What I enjoyed most was how the lights of suns kind of differed depending on what class they were, so for example if you landed on a planet with a sun that shined a blue light, the planet surface would have a kind of moonlit night feel to it rather than that of a scorching orange sun.

The ships and stations all look great (although there are currently only 3-4 looks for stations, to which they'll hopefully add more). Everything in this game graphically draws you in, it's all very immersive and the HUD does a fantastic job of making you feel like you're an actual spaceship pilot, I can only imagine how much more amazing it is with VR.

What's even better though is that this game runs very very smoothly, with a decent rig you could probably play this at resolutions higher than 1080 with no problems whatsoever. I play it on a GTX750ti and I have 0 issues playing the game on a mix of high and ultra settings, and I get 60 fps no questions asked in space, with drops into the 50s and high 40s on planet surfaces. Keep in mind that planetary surfaces are still being optimized for and apparently in the next patch (2.1 engineers) there are a lot of optimizations on that front to make planet surfaces also run much better.

[h1]Music/Sound[/h1]
The sound in this game is absolutely amazing, the roar of engines in different phases of flight is always very nice to hear. Different sized ships also have different sounds, some having a more meaty sound to portary the amount of power needed to push the giant piece of metal around, while some have a more high pitched hum of something like an F1 car. The sounds once again like the graphics do a fantastic job of immersing you into this world, your ship's computer talks to you to give you warnings and status updates if you turn certain modules on and off, and in the next patch it seems like air traffic control of stations will also be voiced and give you directions into the station, calling you by your ship's call sign. All this does is add even more to the immersion. 

In the music department, what is there is great, it has a kind of ""Interstellar"" vibe to it and it really matches the game's theme. I only wish there was more music to listen to while you fly around the galaxy. This wasn't too big of an issue to me though as I found myself having spotify on in the background most of the time anyway.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
If you ever played any other space sim/rpg game this will be familiar to you. A couple months before I tried this game, I had played ""Rebel Galaxy"" and this game is somewhat like a bigger more immersive version of that game (atleast for the amount of time that I played it, I'm not making a direct comparison). You start with a small multipurpose ship that's capable of doing almost any task but not very efficiently. It's up to you to start making money and setting goals for yourself, this game [b]DOES NOT HOLD HANDS[/b]. To make money you can explore, trade/spacetruck, or go into combat. 

The [b]exploration[/b] in this game is very enjoyable if you're into space and the idea of exploring a realistically modeled galaxy. What I mean by realistic in this case is that the galaxy is not litered with interesting things, for the most part you'll run into an ordinary yellow/orange sun, with a couple of barren rocky planets orbiting it. However, sometimes you run into some interesting views, maybe you find a super massive gas giant orbiting very close to the sun, maybe you find two suns orbiting one another with a single planet in between, maybe you find a solar system with nothing but 15 suns. The point I'm trying to get across here is, exploration is very fun and interesting if you're into space and astronomy, there's plenty of little bits of information you can find out about each planet. 

You can also find planets or entire systems that no one else has ever been to in the game and have your name branded on it forever, that to me is a pretty cool and I've been following that ever since I got my exploration ship (the Asp Explorer).

[b]Trading[/b] In this game is kind of shallow as of right now. You have two options, you can either do manual trading for yourself, which is to buy cheap one place, travel far away and sell expensive to another station. In terms of manual trading you can also try to smuggle illegal goods or slaves into stations that have a blackmarket, this can be very profitable. Besides that you can get into space trucking, which means you go to a station and check the billboard, they'll usually have some transportation jobs available, some risky and some more safe. This was a good steady rate of income in my experience.

[b]Combat[/b] careers in this game take the form of piracy, bounty hunting or mercenary work. Piracy is just what it sounds like, bounty hunting has you hanging out at pirate hotspots (resource extraction sites) and scanning ships that pass by. If the ship shows up as wanted, you're free to take them out and collect/redeem the bounty at the specific faction's station. Mercenary work is just mercenary work, being hired and killing for money.

[h1]Complaints[/h1]
One of the major complaints I've seen people have about this game is the ""mile wide, inch deep"" complaint. People complain that the game is shallow and doesn't have much content. I kind of disagree in that regard, I've put 80+ hours into it so far and I'm still not completely burned out on it. This is a galactic sandbox, you kind of have to set your own goals and go about achieving them. With that said, I think people forget that this isn't exactly a finished game in the greater sense, there is still a lot that they are going to add which will hopefully flesh out the game more. 

With that said, it's a life sized galaxy... it's not going to have hand made content sprinkled all over the place. Do you really think there's something to do in every corner of the actual milky way?

Another common complaint is that the game is too grindy. This one I kind of understand but at the same time, it's somewhat of an MMO/RPG, so obviously there is going to be grinding to get the ship that you want. You know what else is grindy? Euro/American truck simulator, and people love that game. I personally found the grind tolerable, because there was always a new ship or module within reach, so the grind always felt like it was towards something. 

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
I'm going to recommend this game to anybody that loves the sci-fi space theme, or is into space/exploration/astronomy at all. For the money that you pay for the base game, it's well worth it. The graphics and sound immerse you into this galaxy, and you're free to go whereever you want, there's a sense of discovery in being the first person ever in the game to jump into a new system, and if you're an astronomy nut you'll love the amazing views, screenshot opportunities and information available to you about each system and it's planets. 

However, if you're big on instant gratification  or not really into space exploration do yourself a favor and pass on this game,",1462163264,1479946647,True,11,1,0.5489455461502075,1,False,False,False,False,,,,359320

Everything is done competently enough. But there is just not much there and not much reason to invest time in it beyond beating your own high score.
It’s a typical tower defense archery game. The graphics are on the realistic side but there are only a few types of enemy and the animations are all the same and less then inspiring in that you feel like you a shooting a tiny arrow into a large orc because of the weak hit animation. Yes, animation singular. Doesn’t matter where you hit them they are going to react the exactly the same way every time. Makes it feel very shallow and not exactly visceral. And that shallowness extends to the sound too. Just the same thing every time ad nauseum.
The only character progression is the unlocking of spells for your arrows. Your character does rank up with play but it doesn’t appear to have any affect on the power of your shots. You also earn gold that you can use to buy better looking equipment but again it’s just cosmetic. You can upgrade the spells but all that does is lower the cooldown time. Still it’s the only character progress you have so better than nothing I guess.
The bow handling is okay. The trajectory seems too flat and doesn’t seem to change enough with angle and range which makes it feel a bit unrealistic but it’s still fun. I don’t like how the arrows magically appear in your hand with the push of a button. I prefer the QuiVR scheme where you at least have to reach to your shoulder like you pulling an arrow from a quiver. But the ‘instant’ arrows are not unique to this game.
I’ve played the single player quite a bit and can reach the low 20’s by myself but the lack of progression has kept me from investing too much time or even checking out the multiplayer. If I want a one off experience I find Longbow to be more fun and frantic and the leaderboards work. And if I want to feel like I’m investing the time in my character I’ll play QuiVR as at least there is better equipment to unlock and the gameplay itself has more variety and depth. 
Bottom line is that’s it's too shallow to reccomend when there are better options out there.

How the HELL did I miss out on this for so long?

At the ending credits I was waiting to see the name of the Marketing people so I could talk shit about them 
 here specifically, and of course there weren't any.  Your publishers did you all dirty on the marketing.

This game is what happens when you put all of your talent everything except Marketing.  If this game were a Dungeons & Dragons character, it rolled a 15 for every stat except Marketing, which rolled a 2.

The world building and environment art are outstanding. The voice acting is great. The narrative is decent. The core game loop is great, 

My only feedback are a few things:
- Fire your publisher and get a better one if you haven't already because their marketing team failed _miserably_ on this
- The character art improvements of the new game you announced recently is perfect, so I won't talk shit about the character art in this game because you all obviously already know
- If I make it to the destination before the dialogue finishes, you guys should have some voice lines to interrupt and say ""alright we're here"" so that we can skip the conversation and continue.  That speed boost upgrade (which I loved) made me have to spin in circles for a few minutes sometimes, which is not fun from a game design perspective
- Many of the choices I made during the story ended up having no pay off or consequences at the end, and so some of those minor story arcs seemed like a waste of time in hindsight

Little things that I especially liked:
- The video game console was great, one of the timed missions started while I was in the middle of a high score run and so I failed it
- The surprise ending gift was great... I just need a button to interact with my friend!
- Letting me free roam around the city and explore after the story is finished is great!

This game may feel like fun in the beginning, but then you realize that there is only one scenario to play and that's it..no modes, no campaign, no multiplayer..nothing

Also it's insanely difficult to win this one scenario even on the easiest settings..you will need to memorize what happens through out the game and pre-plan the next time based on stuff that hasn't happened yet, and in the end it will still be difficult!

Edit: So after the patch the game seems better, at least now one has the option to play an actual easy difficulty and finish the game without too much complex god-like strategy skills and memorization for what lies ahead. Normally I hate easy difficulties and like a good challenge, but in this case it felt way too hard on the easy difficulty and for the wrong reasons, and there isn't a clear way to know you'r not doiing well until the end of that game so it can be frustrating at that point.

Anyway, I realize I was a bit too harsh on tha game before, I probably expected too much of a 9$ game. And above all, the developers response have been awesome, and I value this almost as much as a good game. I wish them well, it's a good first try (if it is) and maybe we'll get better games from them in the future.

A note to the developer tho: yes I am from Egypt and I love storytelling in games, but it needs to be a bit less subtle to grab my attention, needs to play a bigger part somehow..it didn't really connect with me in the game.

I'm changing this to a positive review, for 9 bucks and a few hours, I did have some good fun even if it didn't last forever, but I guess that's fair :)",1476598887,1477166608,True,1,0,0.5397765040397644,0,True,False,False,False,,1477071138.0,"Hello and thanks for the review. The negative review is of course bad for us, but it helps to make the game better and better. We read your comments and just released the 1.0.1 update – which we made as easy as possible for all novice players. They now can play in a training mode and after the historic campaign they can continue to play.

About mods – we're working on Steam Workshop now and when it will be ready, we give the players all the game scripts so they can create their own mods.

Recommended game time is 3-4 hours, during this period, the game will tell you about the ancient history of your country (You're from Cairo, right?), what technologies were discovered by the Egyptians thousands of years ago and will shows you where people lived and what difficulties they have met.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. Two of these are completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Cian

The game has been one of my personal favorites for quite a while now. I always try to find an excuse to gift it to friends who haven't played it yet so I can get them in on it, too. I admit, I'm a little biased. It just so happens the game rolled a lot of my interests together into one experience. Apocalypse fiction? Fascinating art style? Haunting, moody sci-fi? Sad robots? [i]I'm in.[/i]

In all seriousness, though, I think it's a beautifully put together game. The love everyone at Wormwood poured into it really shines through. The deep melancholy of the soundtrack and haunting art style build such a solid atmosphere. I loved picking around the ruins of the world and unraveling the full story bit by bit with each puzzle solved, or item examined. I loved the characters, the personalities they exuded in their dialogue, and all the idiosyncrasies of their cobbled together robot society I was exploring. I loved my jaded, weary, hermit of a protagonist who was still lonely enough to build himself a friend. I love Horatio Nullbuilt v5, my favorite robot.

Primordia is one of those games that I'll be thinking about forever. It makes me wish it had a bigger fandom so I could find more excuses to talk about it all the time.

Sometimes your microphone shows some countdown, no idea what that means. Sometimes you get some audio fragments, not sure when and how. You get attacked by dark orbs which are sometimes invisible (or almost invisible?). If you shoot them, some stuff happens, but I'm not sure weather they're taking damage or not. I understand there are two kinds of ammo, but I don't even get which kind of ammo I'm shooting: lets say there are two stones and then lots of nails in the pipeline, the gun won't stop shooting stones. I guess. You find some recordings you can tinker with. By accident I found a hidden message. No idea how and why, Hell, I did not even find out how to leave this recording menu expect for going to the game's menu via ESC and back.
And a fair warning: As a non-native speaker you'll have a hard time. Understanding words in the static his hard to impossible, and one of the narrators (Bobby) has such a faint voice (without subtitles) that it's hard to get anything he says.

Just wanted to give you an answer to the things you find unclear. 

The countdown on the mic shows your distance in metres from the thing the mic is currently picking up. It can be used to find spots of interest, or orbs to shoot.

After shooting an orb, it disappears and you will record audio. The audio can then be analyzed with your recorder.

You will see what kinds of ammo you have in your pipeline. When loading it's filled from left to right, hence the next ammo going out is on the far right on the UI.

Hidden messages are found when you adjust the playback in different speeds.

You exit the recorder by pressing Q, or use 4 to toggle.

Thanks for the feedback about Bobby's voice.

I liked it, but there came a time when i said enough was enough. I gave up on the game not because it's broken, no because the stories bad, and not because it's a bad game. I stopped because i couldn't stand some design choices made by the developer. If you don't have a problem with some of the issues i have with this game, then it might be a better game then i let on.

This game is good, the stories a bit so-so (i am not a sci-fi fan, so this may not be the case for you), but there is a depth to the world that makes exploration satisfying. For an adventure game (and a sci-fi), it's not bad. Adventure games are usually sold based on their stroy, or their atmosphere and world; this one falls squarely with the interesting world brand of adventure games. It takes a serious stance to its story, so if you wanted another monkey island-ish adventure game, keep looking. The visuals are solid, and what humor there is (mainly in the form of referenceses, such as the crowbar) isn't very satisfying, but it's harmless. 

Where the game lost me is its choice on puzzle design. There comes a time when you have to do some tasks, like convince 2 robots to stop arguing. The problem i have with it is they don't give you the information for long, so you either have to write it down or memorize it. Only after writing it down can you try to solve the riddle. It's a bit backwards, where you have to work around outdated, missing, or omited mechanics to get to the puzzle before you've even had a chance to ponder it. There is a device that records important pieces of information, but what it deems as important can be hit or miss sometimes (such as the robot diologue riddles, where the riddles aren't written down). 

The game also does a very poor job of giving hints if your stuck. This problem, and a few others, are indicitive of the genre. One such problem is having puzzles where you have to guess at what the developer wanted you to use to progress. An example would be ruining soup in some adventure game, where you have mud, shoe polish, and a rat. Only one will ruin the soup, despite all of them being viable in a realist sense. 

In the end, this is an adventure game, so replayability is already low. I'd rather not waste my time reruning the same diologue trees over and over, which is what i found i had to do for the robot riddle puzzles. If I couldn't write fast enough (cus memorizing the jargen and name drops was not easy), i would have to guess and restart. There are i believe 5 riddles or so, so having to restart from the 4th on can be annoying to say the least. At this point, the game felt more like work then fun, so i gave up on it. I didn't want to put in that much effort for what i felt was not enough in return. 

You are expected to bring a lot to the table to get through the game. Good memory, write stuff down, and replay the same section over if you experiment. You will find that trying to force your way through diologue puzzles is very time consuming. If you get stuck and fall back on this, you might feel inticed to cheat (as i was). When i feel like i have to resort to a walkthrough to make progress, the game begins to feels like a chore. It's not fun when you have to use a walkthrough for an adventure game, because relying on it really takes you out of the world. Personally, i call it quits at that point, as i did here

To reiterate, this is not a bad game. It's a game with a vision that i fell outside of. If you played a lot of old-school adventure games, or you're a sci-fi fan, you might find a lot to like. If you find you didn't like older adventure games (or Daedelic's brand of adventure games, like The Dark Eye or Memoria), or you gravitate towards newer games like the Telltale brand of adventure games, this game may not be to you're liking.

If an old-school sci-fi adventure game with some of the problems of older games, as well a bit unforgiving approach to game design (in that you will solve problems for yourself, without more help then the developer deems nessassary) sound good to you, then this might be a game you will enjoy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If anyone should wonder why the developer of the game commented on this review (i was very suprised about it, personally), it's because he questioned some of my reasons for quiting, as well as questioning why i would post a review of a game i played so little of. After being initially pissed, i thought a lot about the review and realized how many assuptions i had taken as fact. I heavily edited the review after i thought about it, namely because the initial review didn't convey what i wanted it to; this game was not for me, for the reasons listed above, but it might be the game for you depending on your tastes. 

The developer didn't harrass me (though initially i thought he had), and i am changing this review because i feel like it. Mark was a decent guy, and he responded more calmly and professionally then i thought he would. I made the changes i did because i was initially wrong, the developer earned my respect, and i had gone back over the review and found it unsatisfactory.

The multiplayer is completely dead, but it could be a bit of fun with friends. However, this game has some huuuuuuge balancing problems. 

There are a few game modes where typing speed isn't sooo important, but if one player can type at 100wpm and one player types at a max of 55wpm, there's no question who is going to win - even if the 55wpm player is, say, better at coming up with words in 'Creativity' mode or has faster instincts. There is one mode where typing speed isn't a significant factor but can still decide matches - Reflection. It's variant, Tug, is still largely decided by typing speed. I just don't see any way this can be much fun with the lack of balance. 

Competition against the AI falls into two categories: way too slow, or impossibly quick, to the point where it is impossible to do things earlier than the AI. It isn't all that much fun even when the AI does match you because the match feels empty.

Typeracer is, unfortunately, way more fun.

I played it for about an hour and I don't think I'll ever touch it again. It definitely isn't worth the $2, and I'll go into exactly why with some more brutal comments as this review draws to an end.

TypeFighters is a poor realisation of a great - but largely impractical - idea. A game that uses typing as its main game mechanic? That's so cool! Typeracer is great and all, but it's not that much fun when the only game element is competing for the top 20 scores of the hour. It's just a singleplayer typing test where the results are compared against other people, and the closest it comes is to 5 people doing the same typing test at the same time. That's *almost* like competitive gameplay, but it's still way too separate. Typeracer is an ego trip - I've wanted a multiplayer typing game where there is both skill and speed involved for a long time. TypeFighters is the exact kind of game I wanted to love, but it's just gets boring too fast.

There are a bunch of modes, but once you've played them a few times, you've played them to death. There's some definite creativity here - I particularly like Tug & Reflection. If only they worked practically. Much like TypeRacer, the competition is still too separate because of the disparate typing speeds between players. It's just too imbalanced for it to be any fun, and there's no depth in the singleplayer to make it worth buying.

They should upgrade and fixed these thing.
1# graphics: are good, need to polish some egdes on textures , weapons, armors and props. 7/10
2# control mechanisms: are minor good, if there were a setting that allow free control of your character's movement with out 
     clipping your character to go to the target this will help a lot.( example: I lock on to an enemy and activate his/her move 
     automatically goes to that target to do the action, instead the setting will allow free control of your character and not 
     allow your character to move automatically when I activate the move if I am trying to dodge incoming area attack.) The 
     lock on also should be fix, because when I was playing My Mage, I locking on to coggweller enemy next to crispy 
     skeleton enemy. I fired at the coggweller dealing amount of damage until some reason on my 7th strike of my move set 
     it started to attack the crispy skeleton even though it wasn't in combat with me and the coggweller was still alive at 
     42% health and attacking me. I was using my keybored numbers to use my actions. This need to be fix or we will pull in 
     unwanted enemies while in combat. 5/10
3# players and characters exsprestions: are not so good, but I seen worst. As much ability to sit in chairs and not the ability 
     to sit down on ground or any where eles this should be a thing. Make up some dance move this isn't ( MJ or 
     Headbanging), also is a loop and not one action move its minor cringey. Not alot of exsprestions in face. They don't 
     even blink and blinking is some thing you should do. The thisg thats is a problem is 2D Adventure Quest Worlds has 
     some blinking at least this and this  Doesn't have blinking even for Blue Flying Eye beast in Greenguard heartwood 
     Forest. Animation of enemies or even players should have this in there animation. Its alot of work animating walking and 
     fighting, but blinking why not? When you talk to a random character you are up in there faces and not once they blink.
     Last thing is seeing face changing to sad, mad, scared, happy or even silly while they do action in the story or player 
     activating them. Its upseting story have animation while talking but can't tel if they are mad or excited for there friend 
     dying in the story line. this is minor exsprestion in storyline. 3/10
4# lack of skills: good, but still waiting. As much for skills, there aren't enough skills to unlock or even none to begin with 
     only classes which doesn't help if you class can't heal with a skill or have a cool move to reduce even more damage. 
     there is only 5 move set that is kinda sad do to  a good amount of RPG quest games online is doing, But if you can give 
     us abilities to unlock if we level Up. 4/10
5# Changing texture on weapon: good and still going up. If you have the time to Changing texture on new armor with the 
      same 3d mesh why not do it for the weapons, I keep seeing the color change but texture of it not changing. (exmple: 
      brought my self a new sword, but they texture is still the same and not seeing anything different only the color change 
      to dark green even my old sword was light green.) 4/10

There are alot of things this game should be upgrading and fix, but only the people who played this game and people who want to make this game even better can only do it. 

Only supporting this game or even other games will help games to grow. Negative comments like ( THIS GAME SUCK, this game gave me aids, this game is crappy or a waist of time playing this don't play it) will not make it better.
Game Developer need real comments that also can help them to make games fun. We might play games for a living or for fun, but they are working making games for us to play. They give us  free to play to try games out and if we want to upgrade our accounts we pay extra, but behind the scene help them to live and slowly upgrade the game.

So is this game good? A good game is hard to tell in other people perspective if they play it. The reason why, we are all different and have different taste in games. what makes a good game is supporting the game developer and there work.

for me I still play it, but still being Upgraded.

I ordered Horizons after previously owning the base game (not connected to Steam). The product actication key was already used, meaning the game can't be launched and just continously requests an update.

Checked to see if anyone else had this problem and saw plenty of examples, not a lot of resolutions. I contacted Frontier support, they didn't help and insisted there was no problem. Hard to tell how common this is: astonishingly diehard fanboys attack anyone making a complaint over official or most third party forums.

Steam, as always, was excellent and refunded the DLC cost after a few days. Lesson learned. Too bad Frontier will be keeping the cash from when I first bought the base game. 

It really looks E:D had the potential to be the definitive space opera game. Persistent bugs, laggy servers and now incredibly terrible support put it in an untimely grave.



Edit 11/15/2021: Tried the game again since the dlc is free and automatically installed now.  The engineers, which are mandatory for setting up a competitive ship, are heavily bugged with two of them being apparently impossible to unlock.  I LOVED this game when it released, so its astonishing that the devs could mess it up as bad as they have.

Edit 4/3/2023.  Why on earth did I try to play this again.  Now the automatically installed Horizons dlc will get you stuck in an updating loop, meaning the launcher never actually loads the game.  There is, as always, no support from Frontier.  Please do not buy a Frontier product, they are scammers.",1492396158,1680532838,False,0,1,0.0,0,False,False,False,False,,1492447453.0,"Hello,

To start off, never treat this game like a serious competitor to great titles like The Elder Scrolls Online or Final Fantasy 14. While those two, for example, do require some time investment to enjoy all that they have to offer, AdventureQuest 3D is more or less a time-killer. You're not playing the game to be completely serious, but because you have free time and this game is conveniently easy on computers and free, and as such, occupy that niche perfectly.

The Artix Entertainment brand of games have never been serious and have been good at being there when there's time to kill, and this game is no other. Much like their flash games, AQ3D maintains the trademark of constantly updating content every week, with no end in sight. Whether this is off-putting is independent to the player. 

The active story, as this review is written, accompanies the main player as a champion for Death itself, with Death's key stolen by a Voidking known as Vane. Your goal is to reach Vane, take the key back, and return it to it's rightful owner. Reusing their iconic characters from previous games, from Faith to Dage, from Rayst to Zhoom, their returns may hype you up or incite cries of repetitiveness. That is independently dependent on the player experience and not the majority.

The gameplay is about as cookie-cutter as standing RPGs can get. If you've even played a standard MMO before, AQ3D's gameplay is literally the basics. They can be forgiven for that as well as their graphics, given that they're mostly known for their 2D expertise, and are slowly improving on their art in a 3D space. Eventually, we can expect high quality art for many items in the future, given they break the mold and work on improving and improving as time goes on.

As with all free games, they will have a cash shop. It's inevitable, and telling any developer to not have one is like telling them to not make money off providing a free service. My only recommendation regarding DragonCoins, Guardian upgrades, and anything else that costs real money is to avoid aggressively marketing them. In this era of gaming, it can be considered predatory and desperate, and the majority of games with microtransactions are already being boycotted for being aggressive with them. It would be the perfect opportunity to innovate and be the leader in a new, less aggressive means of making the money to afford the salaries of the hard-working folks helping with updates, as well as ensure the servers remain affordable. It will also unite the paying customer and the free-to-play playerbase together, instead of dividing them simply because one can spend money whilst the other can't afford to.

All in all, whoever reads this review can decide by themselves on whether AdventureQuest 3D is worth playing. It's a niche game for those with time to spare, and remains on the same podium competing with other games that do not require a massive time investment. While the game does provide some speciality treatment for paying customers as perks and it can dissuade those trying out for free, it is just another RPG that managed to avoid being the cash cow that has ruined games like Wizard101, games that require excessive financial and time investment to catch up.

One question before I end the review: Thinking of giving this game a try or passing on it? Time's a wasting.",1529998095,1621934093,True,2,0,0.52173912525177,0,False,False,True,False,,1530026020.0,"Hello. Thank you for your review. We appreciate your feedback!

AQ3D is not pay to win - none of the items that can make your character stronger are sold for money or micro-currency. There are thousands of items you can gain for free and from playing the game. The game is free to play and we do offer different items and packages you can purchase to help support the game, but the devs always make sure there are plenty of items you can earn for free or purchase from gold. Only cosmetic items are offered for micro-currency which are just the items that make you look different but have no affect on your character strength. 

We are sorry that some of our players can be jerks, this is something that is always going to be a reality in a MMO. You can always ignore and report players in game. We have a party system and a friend system where you can meet other players and player with other people you know who can help you in game. We are also working on guilds. 

Those players how pledged via our Kickstarter are the ones who helped make this game exist. We wanted to make sure these players were rewarded appropriately in game which is why special in game items, features and such were offered. None of the rewards provided are 'pay to win.' 

The devs are constantly working on fixing and improving issues and releasing updates/patches almost weekly. This has been a constant balance as an indie game company with a small staff.  We also have a Game Plan posted here that is updated every Monday - https://aq3d.com/game-plan/.

Too much irritation in its current state to recommend, I simply don't want to play it that much. Please note every negative review has huge downvotes no matter how reasoned or fair it is, the community here has some pretty hostile elements (although plenty of good people as well).

So the GOOD:

Fun combat, good customisation, great look and feel, satisfying feeling to winning a battle. Nicely polished story and cutscenes, good acting, and a lot of care and attention has been put into it.

The BAD:

All of which is set against the mission design which is very disappointing by comparison. The moment that it isnt a fleet vs fleet battle the influence of random chance becomes much too high. Playing a planetary bombardment mission? The locations randomly spawn too far away with too little time to get there even though you positioned in the middle to give yourself the best chance, no chance of winning the mission. Assasination missions where your ships don't even fire a shot before the enemy has escaped and you fail the mission. Escort missions where one time the enemies are nowhere near you and its a walkover, and the next time they are all over you and there is no chance of victory. Data stealing missions which are really poor. 

Judging this game as fleet vs fleet combat only then its a good recommendation, some balance issues but thats understandable.

Judging this game on the campaign where you lose missions without any chance of success and there are big penalties to progressing the campaign from that point on, its highly frustrating having so much be random with the player skill not being able to mitigate, I don't enjoy playing it at all. I like hard but fair games, difficult isn't the problem, its the lack of correlation between player effort/skill/strategy and the results you get.

So overall its a negative, too much of the game is not fun to play and has not been designed well enough, which is really unnecessary as the core mechanics of spaceships fighting each other is excellent.",1462692975,1462725386,False,5,0,0.5250343680381774,0,True,False,False,False,,,,363680

My player with 60 ball control gets dispossesed by a defender with 30 defence just because I rolled a 1 and he rolled a 15. Not once, but time and time again. I have played almost full 5 seasons hoping it will get better once my players improve but no it doesnt get better. Even with an easy RNG setting it still feels extrmeley frustrating.  
On top of that the player progression is extrmely slow. 
I dont mind games with RNG mechanics but in this one I feel my strategy has no implication as my players dice roll is mostly unfair. 
It seems more luck that strategy. 

I really want to like this game but cant.
The devs should study the RNG mechanics of Darkest Dungeon and Xcom in detail so that it feels more strategy and less luck. Maybe introduce the critical chance concept or a skill set based dice roll instead of a random dice roll.

Your usual attributes are only a basic layer of the tactics. But you should combine them with skills and other advanced technics (like crossing) to make your team shine.

For example, when you combine a midfielder with the Long pass and a universal forward with Cannon Shot - you will see how many there are possibilities to score. Just learn how to use Cannon Shot. Same with other skills and mechanics,

I was really excited for icons combat arena, and i was surprised to see it was free on its ""official release"" (open beta), and its even marketed as a free platform fighter https://i.imgur.com/2mqRWn8.png, however, of the seven characters, three are playable, as it turns out, the game actually costs $25 USD and that's how you unlock ""all current and future characters"". Another thing to be found on the store is essentially a deluxe edition at $40 USD, you get a beta skin and a beta icon, as well as 5 portal packs. What are portal packs? I have no idea, the game doesn't directly tell you on the store page but I'm making an assumption that they are more or less loot boxes. You can buy these portal packs at a minimum of 2 for $3, at most 55 for $50, and looking further into the store it seems you can get player selection cursors, player icons, skins/alt colors, emotes, voice lines, sprays, victory poses, and platforms that you spawn on when you lose a stock. Along with the loot system is an in game currency system where you can use ""Spectra"" to unlock the mentioned loot drops, it appears loot drops have rarities; common, uncommon, and legendary. I'm sure its possible to earn the IGC and lootboxes through playing online, so I tried two quick play sessions, and was correct in my assumption of getting a lootbox through leveling up and im probably also right on getting Spectra through duplicate drops. This ludicrous system of loot drops seemed immediately familiar to me when i first saw it and instantly reminded me of Blizzard's system of loot drops in games such as Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm. It becomes more apparent when the icons and sprays mimic Overwatch's types of icons and sprays, ""cute sprays"", ""8-bit sprays"", and minimalistic icons are apparent, obviously these are just art styles, and are probably (maybe) coincidental, but the comparisons are there, and still equally worrying. It should be noted that I never closely followed the games development (I did heavily at first, through the announcement of Ashani and Kidd, but dropped off from there, likely because I forgot about it), so if all of this was previously announced then I wouldn't know but it was a big, dissapointing, surprise to me.

Now, onto the ACTUAL gameplay and again, as I was limited to three of seven characters, I can only really talk about those fighters, I havent had much time to play these characters much as of wirting this review since I felt the above paragraph was important to write as soon as possible, though so far it feels about how a platform fighter should feel, for the most part, the game is in open beta so I'll give Wavedash a chance to fix things such as netcode being inconsistant, a weird input buffer that makes the game feel stiff, and odd stage design that makes recovering feel weird, maybe im just bad at the game though :~) ;

Ashani - A pretty close take on C.Falcon, she has a neat meter build mechanic that improves her neutral special, it loses charge over time unless it's maxxed out which makes her style of play ""mandatorily  agressive,"" and I think is a nice addition of the C.Falcon archtype, my perfered character of the three to use, she also has a very cool design and i think i love her

Kidd - A close take on Melee Fox/Falco, he has a slow fox laser, a ""heavy"" phantasm, a short shine (of which can be jump canceled and can be multishined), and more or less has Fox's recovery with the active hitbox and slow startup, but long distance. Because of his slower lasers, its difficult to do even one shorthop laser but thats okay. His design is kinda odd to look at but its still refreshing nevertheless 

Xana - A definitely unique take on Ganondorf (Brawl/Sm4sh), mostly, surprisingly, a grapple character, which is interesting to see in this sort of fighting game, she has a counter grab, a side special grab, and an ""up/down"" recovery, her neutral special is a lariat, which can be used for stage control. Her design is very much like Zarya's from Overwatch, but she's an alien, its still a good design, just seems a bit lazy to me.

Universal mechanics- Directional air dodging (Melee style), sheild/rolling/spot dodging, and directional influence are all immediately and obviously found in the game, which is to be expected in a platform fighter inspired by melee, you can wavedash, you can waveland, but ledge canceling, while probably would be useless in this game, isn't obviously present, which is fine, most if not all aerial moves are relatively lagless and can be SHFF'd easily, L-canceling isnt in the game which is also fine, it shouldn't be a neccessary mechanic, I think its better off not in the game as long as the aerials arent as laggy as they are in Melee, so I don't miss the lack of L-canceling, something similar to an extended dash dance can be done, and dash dancing in general is easy to use, there is a new, unique mechanic in this game which i can only describe as an advancing guard, using special while sheilding, the player can push away opponents at the cost of their ""sheild life"", the push away isnt too significant, and I think it could use a bit of reworking, as it is also sorta hard to do anything afterwards, aside from jumping away (it is possible to jump oos, I should add)

Overall some hit/hurtboxes could use some tweeking, its possible to get weird reverse hitboxes on some characters but I expect as much from an open beta game

Finally, the game's art direction is pretty good in my opinion, some effects could use some work (such as Kidd's jet smoke), but that comes down to subjective opinion.

I'd say to give this game a chance, if it werent for the very poor practices with lootboxes and the method of unlocking what I assumed to be the begining roster, if you want to main Ashani, Kidd, or Xana, then go for it, hopefully youll be able to play the game for free, forever, but for someone like me who wanted to try Weishan or Zhurong, I would rather have to pay for the game upfront, than have to look at these characters behind a lock screen each time i want to play the game, if the closed beta had access to these characters why dosent the open beta have access to them? 

I hope to see improvements to these money making schemes but I doubt I will, I'll probably play here and there and then completely drop the game when Smash Ultimate comes out, overall I'm dissapointed in this first look at the game. I would definitely pay full price for this game if lootboxes were removed, access to all characters were available (aside from a few DLC characters), and unlocking things such as skins and emotes were obtained through more than just paying for them and playing QP forever. I understand this game can technically be completely be F2P, but this method of trying to acheive that kinda sucks a lot.",1531591511,1531591593,False,15,1,0.587180733680725,0,False,False,True,False,,1531620744.0,"This review is TREMENDOUSLY helpful. Thank you for taking the time to write it in such detail!

Reading through, it looks like your concerns primarily sit with the F2P system. Is that correct? We're hearing this loud and clear from the community, and Early Access is about evolving until the F2P system is exactly right.

For now, based on community feedback we are working on these areas:

[b]- Earning spectra[/b]: We will be adding several more ways to add spectra, so you can earn it directly through playing. We want players to see faster, better progress towards the specific items they want in the shop.
[b]-Unlocking a character faster[/b]: In the next few weeks, we will have new tools for the designers to add character unlocks to different milestones in the game, like an early levelup
[b]-Adding ways to try out characters[/b]: Adding tech to give players more ways to try out a character before buying one, such as in training mode. (The feature here may change, but that's an example of how we're thinking about it based on your concerns.)

Some of these may take some time, but you'll see the first efforts of this coming online soon.

The combat is decent for a cross-platform game, and I feel comfortable playing it on both PC and mobile. As for the story, I never take it too seriously.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the performance and stability of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development from our two-man code team. 

There is also now the second expansion, the Crucible survival mode, that was free for all! 

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

Your recommendation for both fitness enthusiasts and beginners looking to get into shape through VR is greatly appreciated. We're committed to continuously improving the app and providing an engaging and effective workout experience for all users.

Today I decided to start reviewing the games that I have tested or played enough to tell about me experience.
Weeeeellll.......
This game isn't the one I would recommend.
Here are some reasons why:
     a)
        Combat system is really bland. ""Uncooked"" as I would say... To put it nicely... NOT FUN.  Just spam 1 or other three keys without even thinking and trying and you will come out a winner. That's it. 
     b)
        Skill Trees are non-existent in this game. Spawn in -> Choose class-> Five or six abilities till the end of the game. Nothing more. If the game did persuade you in expanding your skills and abilities it would have become a lot more interesting.
     c)
        Farming is an esential element in any MMO RPG. This game is an example of a poorly executed one. Farming is not fun at all and in a mix with a bad combat system is almost fatal for the gameplay. 
     d)
        Quest are all repetative as HELL. Kill some mobs->Bring them back->kill some mobs->Bring them back->Talk to someone->Come back-> REPEAT. The most ""CREATIVE"" one was to water flowers by cliking on them. It was also not fun
      e)
        Graphics are ofcourse a problem. A game that young having graphics of a game of the start of the previous decade is not just dissgraceful, but also sad.
       VERDICT:
         The game is still in an ""Early Access"" mode, where things can and ofcourse will change and the game is quite promissing in it's way. But the problems are currently overwhelmingly fatal and are a big threat to the project, that is  really immportant for people, who grew on this developer's games (Adventure Quest World) and who do fill nostalgic about this game.

Edit: The game now supports framerates higher than 30fps. Thanks, devs!

I haven't played much of it, but from what I've played, I mostly like it. It's like something you'd find on the PS2, but with slightly better graphics. I hear it's a bit short, and the season pass is definitely not worth $30, but overall, I think it's fine, and mostly doesn't deserve the large amount of negative reviews from Chinese players (although I can understand their frustration given that Monkey King is a rather famous IP there). The reason I say mostly is that the PC port is pretty bad. Despite running on Unreal Engine 4, the game is locked at 30fps, and for a game running on that engine, and being an action platformer and all, it's not ideal. There is also zero graphics options whatsoever besides resolution and brightness/gamma, and while there is forced temporal anti-aliasing, it could have done better in that department.

For this review, I'm not going to focus too much on the gameplay, since it's not really the focus of the game itself.  I'll just say that this game is somewhere between a visual novel and a choose-your-own-adventure game.  There's only one save file and you have no control over when it saves, you have three lives to lose, and once you lose them, your only option is to start a new game (though you can start from the beginning of any of the game's three acts that you have previously reached--though from a new state, not with the same attributes you had before).  It's honestly not what I would call ""fun"" in and of itself, but it [i]does[/i] add more weight to the decisions you make, and since you're always making new decisions, that makes the overall game stronger.

(Some early-game advice, if you want it: Although it's probably possible to beat the game on your first playthrough, [i]you[/i] are not going to accomplish that.  Rather than make your initial goal to be to reach the end of the game, instead, make your first goal be to reach the milestones that give you bonuses on future playthroughs: Focus on hunting one type of animal per area until you learn the animal's ""way"", and focus on completing the harder, longer sidequests to earn the tarot cards.  Once you've died a few times, you'll also know what choices NOT to make on future playthroughs.)

I'm also not going to focus on the game's writing, since you have no idea what I consider good writing or whether it matches your own preferences.  I can say that the writing is poetic, describing a pre-civilization world that [i]would[/i] look familiar to us, except it's being described using terms that the narrative never outright explains, but expects us to pick up through the context of how those words are used.  And I think that's neat, but I don't really have enough background with this type of story to say whether it pulls off this style of writing better than other stories of its type.

Rather, I'm going to focus on this game's philosophy, since the game is nothing BUT philosophy from beginning to end.

Growing up, I was interested in philosophy because I was interested in ethics.  I wanted to make sure that I was doing the right thing, as much as it was within my capacity to do so, and philosophy helps make it clear that just because something [i]feels[/i] right in your gut, it may have indirect or long-term consequences that you don't immediately see.  Same thing for things that initially feel wrong--sometimes there's good reasons to be doing something that appear wrong on the surface, or maybe sometimes you have to choose between two evils and it's better to know which one at least leads down a path with good potential.  The more I learned about ideas like this, the more I felt like I was coming to a better understanding of what ""true morality"" was.

But the more I followed people who approached the same lines of thought, the more I started noticing something.  Once you have a full enough understanding of philosophy, you can use words to justify literally any action you can take, no matter what it is.  Not everything is a virtue, but there are enough virtues that are commonly accepted [i]as[/i] virtues that you can boil any decision down to a conflict between two or more of those virtues, at which point you can always say ""Well, who am I to say which of these virtues is the most valuable one?""  In other words, it started feeling to me like philosophy was really just an exercise in arguing yourself into inaction as the ""wisest, most reasoned"" path.  Not to mention that looking at things this way basically also made true morality inaccessible to anybody who wasn't intelligent/considerate/resourceful enough to look at things from all angles like this.  I lost my taste for this way of thinking about things.

I bring this up because Golden Treasure is ENTIRELY ""view the world from all possible angles, from the vantage point of any value system you could possibly have,"" but I love it.

Although I don't know that I'd say that this game addresses my issues with this line of thought in a direct sense, I think it does acknowledge them in spirit.  It doesn't send the message that inaction is a viable path, because there are moments where you're forced to choose between multiple opposing, but equally good, philosophies, or else die--but at the same time, it also doesn't judge you for choosing death.

It also doesn't try to frame things as if every decision is equally good, because even though it's exploring lots of different ideas, it clearly frames SOME of those ideas as being more beneficial or harmful than others.  But at the same time, it acknowledges that it's the right of every living being to fight for its own values, and to me that implies that even though the game is fighting for its own values, you're more than justified to fight back against whatever those values are.  (This is perhaps highlighted by the fact that human beings are basically portrayed as the main antagonists of the game, albeit with the level of nuance that you would expect from the type of story I'm describing.)

I think what's special to me about Golden Treasure: The Great Green is that it represents what it was that I wanted philosophy to be.  Morality may be an inherently paradoxical concept, but I still want to be able to explore the beauty inherent within it.  When I feel constrained by pursuing the objectives of my own life, I want to know that there are other ways of living that I may never have even considered--and that even if I never get the chance to experience them, that at least someone else is, or will.  I want to be able to believe that all life has value and a place in the world, even the life that I, in my current state, with my current values, see as immoral.  I don't know that I have the strength/weakness necessary to truly believe that, but just the idea that it's a possibility helps me move forward.

If most or all of this applies to you as well, I definitely recommend the game.  For the other 99% of you, just download the demo.

First, they explain to us how to check the documents, then they show us where to rest, how to cut tires and seats in search of contraband, where to put criminals, and so on. 
After completing the training, all this seems very obvious and understandable, but the player would definitely not be able to guess the many gameplay features on his own, so the training deserves special praise. 
Moreover, you need to understand that the checkpoint post is not everything that is implemented in this simulator. 
We’ll also have to travel by car, catch villains, and even shoot from a pistol.

The most important thing, of course, is to find the smugglers who want to trick you and smuggle something across the border that cannot be smuggled. 
To prevent this, the player needs to inspect the documents of the citizen and his transport. 
These are two completely different processes, which are connected with each other. 
First, the player must take the person’s passport and other documents, starting to verify the data with each other. 
It is necessary to verify the name and surname in all provided documents, compare the expiry date of the passport with today, compare the stamp and background of the passport with the official data for a specific country.

All the necessary data for comparison is available in the border guard’s notebook – there are indicated all the parameters that need to be paid attention to when evaluating the documents, there is a list of all currently available countries and all the data we need are indicated – what stamps can be, what passport colors are used in this country.
Accordingly, if a person has one country indicated, and builds a seal from another, then it is worth taking a closer look at it and, of course, not letting it cross the border.
There are actually many such subtleties, but in an hour you will understand them at a glance.

It is important to clarify that our border guard has a stamina parameter, which is spent every time you compare parameters in documents using mouse clicks. 
However if you recheck everything several times or miss the mark, then by the end of the working day your endurance will end, and you will have to compare names, document numbers and seals by yourself, by eye.
However, this is even more interesting – there is no sense of casualness.
Moreover, it makes no sense, for example, to spend stamina comparing names or passport numbers – they can be compared by eye in a couple of seconds, it is better to spend energy on something important or not spend it at all.

Don’t forget about transport
After checking the documents, it is worth opening the form and putting crosses in those points that did not agree, and then proceed to inspect the car.
Open all the doors and trunk, look under the hood, run through the cabin looking for suspicious things.
Here you can even unload everything from the trunk, inspect and compare with the import invoice, banning the entry of the truck if it contains prohibited items or goods.
Of course, you can not only inspect the interior for contraband, but also open seats, upholstery or tires in search of something prohibited.
Everyone shouldn’t cut tires in a row – they will be fined if you just spoil a person’s property.

To find a smuggler, you need to study the latest news reports, plus examine the list of suspects at a special stand. 
If, for example, there is a suspicion that contraband will be brought in today on such and such a car, then such a car should be inspected especially carefully.
By cutting the seats and tires of the car, I was able to find contraband in the form of cigarettes, alcohol, packs of money and even drugs.
For this, a citizen who tried to bring all this good to the country was sent to a temporary detention facility, and everything confiscated was thrown into a warehouse.
Oh yes, you can still close your eyes to the violations of the citizen and take a bribe, letting him into the country, or you can put an innocent person in prison.
That is, the developers thought of the possibility of a bad guard, who in a bad mood puts everyone in a row.

Life outside the checkpoint
Surprisingly, the gameplay of the simulator during the inspection of documents and cars at the checkpoint does not end – the game has already implemented a fairly large map.
The player has the function of delivering prisoners from a temporary detention facility to a prison, plus we ourselves deliver all the seized illegal to the state warehouse, receiving good monetary rewards for both these actions.
For example, after the surrender of all the contraband and two prisoners, more than a thousand dollars fell into my account, which I then went and safely spent on tools.
Yes, in a communist country, the guard buys himself tools for opening the cabin, tires and other containers in search of contraband, so the gamer will have to periodically go to the merchant and buy everything he needs.
This is a very interesting process, since you need to look at the map constantly, while turning on the flashing lights and not crashing into everyone.
In addition, there are situations when attackers simply hit the gases, breaking through the barrier – in such situations we can sit in a “loaf” and overtake the criminal, crashing into him at full speed.
It’s an insanely fun process, in fact.

Conclusion
At the moment, I can confidently say that I liked comparing documents at the checkpoint, looking for inconsistencies and putting a red stamp in a passport, and the process of assessing a car, inspecting it and opening it are quite exciting activities.",1678305814,1678305814,True,2,0,0.5424213409423828,0,True,False,False,True,,1678368426.0,Thank you!

Some of the graphics still need work but the game brings back a wave of nostalgia if you are an AQW player. There are still minor bugs and issues but I assume as the game moves from Early Access to being fully released that these issues will be resolved.

This game does not feel pay to win as AQW does, you can buy two packages and they are not subscription-based like AQW. I bought the $50 package and the $5 starter bundle and have been enjoying the game with the additional cosmetic items.

We really appreciate your kind words and detailed feedback regarding AQ3D and AQW. We are so honored to receive such a kindhearted review from you so we wanted to take the time to thank you for reaching out! 

We are so glad to hear that you've been enjoying the cosmetics and items in-game, as our team works hard to create items that make our game fun for everyone. We try to keep core items out of paid bundles, that way everyone can level up and play our games without having to pay. That said, we are happy that you like your cosmetic items! Our team appreciates your support, because although it is optional, it does mean a lot to us here at the Secret Underground Lab. 

Again, we want to keep our game as fair as possible for all players, so that people can return to Battleon whenever they want without paying to unlock items or features. Our team is glad you enjoy the direction of AQ3D- we hope it has been as fun for you to play as it is for us to develop! 

While we're still working on some aspects of the gameplay, we would love to invite you to AQ3D dot com, where you can learn where the game is headed via the News and Game Plan. Until then, we hope to see you again in-game soon!

This game might work if you pick a top team from the start, but if you're like me and like to start from the bottom division, you'll find the game is pretty much broken.

Having said that it's also almost impossible not to succeed since once again the economic and club building systems rely on nothing more than playing a lot of matches. eventually, no matter what division you are in, you will have enough to get to top division, but it's just a grind, grind, grind and nothing you do can change that.

If you know how to use skills, how to perform crosses, how to use strong sides of different classes (for example, wing forwards with high Control allow to score easy goals), you can win even stronger teams.

Experienced players ask us to make the game even harder because they easily rice from league to league and there's not enough challenge for them. That's because they know use skills a lot to gain +1 bonus action, score with crosses etc.

If you give the game another chance, you should concentrate on using skills. Also, change the formation according to every opponent.

Resonance tried cool stuff with the character switching, but I found it confusing at times. I was stuck multiple times in Gemini Rue (which obviously could be me being stupid) and think that the game sometimes had no direction to push the player to.

Primordia is just a pleasant ride from start to finish. Some of the code puzzles are a bit hard, but never frustrating. The story is just great. I loved the dark and gloomy tones and the sarcastic MC. Set in a dying world the game throws all kind of grey moral choices at the player.

I believed I responded to you on the forums as well but I'm going to repost my response here in hopes that it helps.

We'd certainly expect a GTX 1070 to easily run the game at full settings so that's truly surprising.

We run GTX 1080s (and I had a 780ti at home) in the office and have no issue maxing out 1440p at 60fps under almost all circumstances.

I'd love to get a look into what performance issues were occuring for you and see the crash logs for the aforementioned ""Freeze and die"". Did you try installing the game on a different drive? 

Additionally A few weeks ago we had someone with serious issues with load times and performance both of which were traced back to his Pagefile being on a failing hard drive. Once he moved that all issues were resolved. This user was also reporting load times in the minutes.

If you still have the game installed then I'd love to get my hands on the latest output log or crash logs from the game, as well as a copy of your dxidag. You can email them to me at support@brightrockgames.com.

You can find instructions on how to get those files here: https://support.brightrockgames.com/knowledge-bases/2/articles/118-how-to-submit-a-bug-ticket

Sorry once more and hope I can at least provide some clarity on what happened here.

Hi Snerpes

We're close to the launch and we're checking old reviews to see if we fixed all problems which got reported.

We added new tutorials, one separate for building and one for how to play the new survival mode.

You still have to build the drone yourself and set the keymappings to your liking, that did not change (we focus on building instead of more arcady action). But we added tutorials to make the learning curve more acceptable. If you play the game again, please let us know if we improved that :)

cheers,
Markus

Hi Snerpes

Please note that the controls are completly built by yourself.
Depending on where you place the thrusters, how you rotate them (using the mouse wheel) and which keys you assign, the drone is controlled differently.
Using a directional sensor, you can even build a drone that follows your mouse cursor!

Please try it out and let me know if this info helped you :)

Cheers,
Philomena",383840

But it's some feedback for the developers at least, it's free to try, and this might entice someone to watch for future updates, so.....

I've given it a positive overall, as it has potential. To be blunt though: they released this demo too early and it has left a somewhat stunted first impression. Sound glitches, graphics glitches, a mouse cursor that refuses to disappear and annoyingly flickers all the time, other irritating game play issues, and totally crashing my pc, are some of the things they really ought to have fixed before releasing this taster.

Those are the negatives, and, yes, they will no doubt get fixed in time, but some of my issues with it aren't technical ones. Due to it crashing I can't say just how well they've realised certain elements of the game: it's described as a metroidvania, but my limited time with it didn't show anything along those lines. So for now I'm only treating it as an action game.

In that regard...it's okay. It plays smoothly and responsively, and has mild stealth elements, which I suppose are a relatively fresh addition for the genre. Having said that...this is no Mark Of The Ninja, as the enemies can be a bit too twitchy for it to work consistently, and other aspects go against it. 

It's a flip screen game, so what you don't want to be doing is going to jump on an enemy and unleash ""death from above"", only to find that instead the game jumps you out of the current screen briefly before you fall back down again...which alerts the guard who has been reset to his previously facing direction, and now shoots you.....

It will require a pretty fundamental change to how they display the game  for this to work better. Which is a bit crap anyway - why the hell do you still have flip screen games in 2020? It suggests a bad grasp of the Unity engine when you're using a technique that was technologically necessary 30 years ago, but sure as heck isn't in this day and age. 

This stealth mechanic doesn't make the game unique, and it's certainly not unique as an action game, so they're going to have to improve this clunky aspect of it if they hoped it would make it stand out. Right now it's no better than Blasphemous, Dead Cells, Dark Light, The Messenger and about a bazillion other games, but it plays worse than those - which is going to be obvious as it's fairly incomplete, and they're finished games (or more advanced in their development)

The graphics are alright, but there's better looking games. It's lacking any music, which somewhat undermines the impact of the game play. Combat is slick enough, though missing a bit of oomph due to the absence of any score to emphasise it. Dark Light plays just as well, but has a superb soundtrack that makes it stand out when compared to this. 

(EDIT: This does have music, but it's fairly quiet in the overall volume of the game, and more ambient than exciting / intense / menacing etc. Which undermines the relatively capable level of the action) 

Storywise it's well told, and has a surprisingly decent voiceover and animated cutscenes.

It has the potential to be a decent game, but based on my brief time with this demo (bearing in mind it was short due to it crashing - it might have some mindblowing game play I missed) a lot of work needs to be put into it for me to recommend it as essential. Right now I'd say Dark Light has it well beaten for being a game I'm excited for.

Not so much any more. First of all, if you've played Binding of Isaac-- congratulations! This game is basically just trying to be Binding of Isaac. I'm not saying that in a disparaging ""every roguelite is Binding of Isaac,"" I'm saying it in a ""this game literally rips entire concepts from it without changing them."" Seriously, the main differentiating feature in this game is that it's a 2D platformer rather than a 2D top down game, as well as some objectively bad mechanics stapled on top.

You start with a few characters, all of whom have different starting healths, grenades (this game's equivalent to bombs), keys, etc. as well as some having unique gimmicks. Interestingly, the only two starting characters with any playstyle variety happen to be the two that are offered as DLC on day 1! Isn't that interesting? One of them has what is functionally a double jump, and the other can eventually fly. Objectively stronger than the base 2 characters who have... nothing unique whatsoever. Progression in this game works as follows: you go into the starting level, you wander around killing enemies, collecting grenades and keys, and go into a treasure room which gives you a free upgrade item. You can then potentially find a store, some challenge rooms, etc. to get more items. You then fight a boss and after winning you can either continue to go back and explore the area or head down to the next level. This is all sounding remarkably similar to another game, isn't it? 

I'll jump into a few differences. In Isaac, you basically have 1 attack for every single character with no differences: firing tears. Your attacks get different properties as you pick up passive items. In NA, instead, the way your attack works depends primarily on the weapon you pick up-- sort of like Gungeon. Different attack patterns, bullet shapes, etc. Sure, half of them are variations on ""slowly charge up a laser"" but some of them are interesting. Then you have the passive items which impact how your bullets work. Many of which are basically the same as in Isaac, but to be honest they aren't unique to either game, just kind of standard stuff like piercing, explosive, poison, fire, etc. The weapons also have active abilities-- so instead of having a separate item tied to a use key like in Isaac, instead whenever you right click with a given weapon you will consume some charge and use the ability. Now, in Isaac, this charge was given whenever you changed rooms, however in NA, you get it randomly from drops of purple crystals, which can drop in 1, 2, or 4 clumps. Or they might not drop at all, hamstringing you with RNG.

But that's not even the worst of it, since you probably don't want to use those crystals anyway, since you need them to buy your way into certain doors, as well as use certain chests, and an interactable pillar-thing. Whenever you spend crystals in this way, you'll build up a meter in the bottom right-- it's called wisdom, but that doesn't matter. Basically it's a meter that will give you a free item from a set of 2 items: it's the Angel room from Isaac. You get charge for these meter by avoiding damage as well as cashing in the crystals. The issue is that the amount of charge you get for avoiding damage is completely pitiful, and the actual uses for crystals don't always show up, meaning you won't get access to the room entirely by virtue of RNG. And, yes, like the angel and devil rooms in Isaac, there is a counterpart. The counterpart is acquired by, whenever you see a crystal cash-in-thing, damage it first, and then run into it to damage yourself and fill the meter. So kind of the opposite of how you'd want to get it in Isaac. You then can choose to sacrifice one of your heart containers and then get access to 1 of 3 items. So, yeah, basically a devil room. I don't honestly mind this, because I liked that mechanic in Isaac-- however there's a huge difference here. In Isaac, the angel and devil rooms had unique, powerful items that made it incredibly worthwhile to play perfectly in order to get even better benefits and abilities. In NA, they're just regular treasure rooms. You don't even get to *see* what you're going to get if you sacrifice health in the devil room equivalent, so you can't make an educated risk, it's just pure RNG. And I guess now that I've brought it up a few times, let's get into the RNG elements, shall we? Because I'll list a few examples of things that they added to the genre that really add to the ""difficulty"" of the game.

In Isaac, slot machines were little interactables in a room that you could fire off some of your extra coins into and potentially get rewarded. In NA, they are *doors*. You spend 5 coins sort of like you'd spend a key, and you have a *chance* of opening the door and going to whatever is behind it. That's kind of annoying, but it's not awful... except when you realize that they also took the mechanic from Isaac where after a random number of uses the machine will just break. You'd think that would mean that the door would break and you could open it with like a bomb or something-- no, it's just locked shut forever now. [Edit] As of the experimental branch at the time of writing, the devs have made it so that when a slot machine door explodes, it opens. Good change.

Pets in this game are literally just the followers from Isaac; they either follow behind you in a conga line or they spin around your character and block shots and the like. The ones following you attack enemies or do something else. Many of them are basically identical to ones from Isaac, but we've already stomped that into the dirt anyway. In Isaac, you pick them up like any other passive item. In NA, you instead have another random pickup-- eggs. This causes little easter egg looking things to follow behind your character, where after a few screens and the like they eventually hatch into a follower. Except when they don't. Yeah, the eggs can sometimes just not give you anything. Which, you know what, that's fine, it's a little RNG thing that might give you a little bonus but it's basically just a powerup, since they can be killed and disappear, unlike in Isaac. Except... many are hindrances. [Edit] Originally at this point in the review, I went into how many of the pets ended up being basically worse than useless and harmed the player. The devs have actually made a new version of the egg pickup that explicitly contains these questionably useful and potentially dangerous pets. This is a good change, and removes most of my issues with the pet mechanic.

[Edit] The devs have already started to address a lot of the problems many users have with the game. I respect that. I'm glad to see that they're already moving ahead with quality of life improvements and rebalancing some of the more questionable aspects. Something else I couldn't get into in the original review due to character limits was the lack of enemy variety. Apparently many of the enemy varieties were actually locked behind the upgrade tree in the game, but have now been changed to be based on the final bosses. So that should mean overall much more variety in the game, which is also a good change. I still don't think the game is worth its current asking price in terms of quality, but judging by how fast the devs respond to community feedback, I'd say in a month or so I might come back and re-assess this review.",1594774631,1594951155,False,315,17,0.694353699684143,27,True,False,False,False,,1594927513.0,"Hey there,

Thanks for the review! We are taking in all the feedback from launch and have just made live an optional experimental branch with many of the most requested features and changes added. 

Here’s a few that are addressed that were in your feedback:

On pets, the Vibrant Ball is now out of the game whilst we rework it, several of the other trouble pets (Peter the cat, Grabber, Jack, Dr.Blue) have a new ‘naughty’ egg system where you need to manually pick them up like an item.

On RNG issues, the slot machine opens once it explodes, Wisdom progress is only 50% reset if you have some violence, the first shop has a 50% sale and you can now see item names.

We’ve increased the time the item description stays on the screen when you pick them up. Plus, we’ve lowered the god coin cost of the upgrade tree.

A big one on screen clutter is that enemy bullets/attacks will be in front of the players attacks to make the game more readable.

These aren’t exhaustive and we’ll be working hard to make sure that lots of other common suggestions are considered. We’re committed to making the game the best it can be! 

You can see the full list and how to get it here: https://steamcommunity.com/games/788100/announcements/detail/2753339286193349786

On your points about similarities, we have been compared a lot to several of the popular proceeding roguelites and whilst it isn’t a copy, it does stand on the foundations of other roguelites sharing a lot of common mechanics in the genre. We do feel we have brought our own unique mechanics and twists like the potential item synergies that combine with weapons and your characters, the progression tree, the mini-games, the way all items stack visually, the Manager system, advanced pet system and neon theme.

We hope you’ll give the game another try!

It seemed to be causing a conflict in the controls.  Several hours lost figuring out how to make it work.  To the devs-- does it really have to be this difficult? I mean, it's on steam, so you kinda have to make stuff like this work seamlessly with the platform, especially since controls make or break this game.  I never have to do this finagling with my other games on steam. Anyway, after getting the gamepad to work, it is also recommended to spend some time mapping controls to the buttons.  

When playing the game itself expect a steep learning curve when it comes to flying your ship, but that's just a matter of patience, and is part of the experience in playing these kind of space sim games.  It is highly recommended  to take the tutorial to learn to fly.  It's still not enough though, and you will likely need to consult some guides online in order to understand how to fly more smoothly in the game.  

I found Horizons more interesting than Odyssey (you can launch either version from the starting window) since horizons was about the ship flying and odyssey is more about the on foot shooting.  No Man's Sky seems to handle the transition between ship and on foot mode much more smoothly, but that's just a nitpick.

Overall, the game really could benefit from doing a more thorough job guiding players, as I can see the steep learning curve discouraging some players from spending more time in the game., and as I said, they need to make it so that the controls just work-- whether it's a gamepad, keyborad/mouse, flight stick, etc..  Clearly a lot of work has gone into the game, and there's a lot of potential, and if they just make it more accessible, then it would give Starfield, No Man's Sky, etc. a run for their money.  Maybe offer players a choice to have a more arcade style flying mode as an option, and players can choose whether to have it more sim-like or more like No Man's Sky.  I tend to prefer the more sim-like experience, but I also play No Man's Sky and that is fun in it's on way because the mechanics are more simple and straightforward, and encourages exploration.  All that being said, if you can get past the issues, the game will provide some hours of fun for sure.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the performance and stability of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development from our two-man code team. 

There is also now the second expansion, the Crucible survival mode, that was free for all! 

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

Mostly because I did play the 2D Flash version years ago.

Has my view of the game improved somewhat? Yes, surprisingly it has.
Would I still recommend it for other players? Depends on what kind of game you expect to find. If a fun little time-waster is what you are seeking, then yes. If you want a MMORPG with fleshed out combat mechanics, that require meticulous strategy between players, then no.

Okay so let go over the positives of the game.
-Impressive looking level design, that have a nostalgic feel to those that played the 2D Flash versions. Only in 3D.
-Classes are actually diverse enough, with some excelling against certain enemies than others.
-Quirky humour that did bring a chuckle out of me.
-Mini-games that are pretty diverse, some of which are surprisingly fun to play.
-Plenty of challenging secrets for players to discover, with some requiring help from others. This is a game that is more fun to play with others.

Not every game is perfect, even the most pristine MMO's on the market have their negatives. AdventureQuest 3D unfortunately has a lot of them.
-Crafting is tedious in places, where it doesn't allow multiple items of the same type to be queued. Only one at a time.
-Character movement can be janky, which makes some parkour runs harder than necessary.
-A lack of audio in cutscenes, such as dialogue, sound effects, music. The only thing I hear is the level music in the background, which at times doesn't fit with the scene very well.
-Some quests that feel more like a chore instead of something fun to do.
-Connectivity issues, despite having a decent internet connection at home.
-Combat can be broken at times, especially the Silence and Stun status effect which are exactly the same. Plus some enemies don't have resistances to certain elements (like fire type enemies takes just the same amount of damage from a fire spell as from a non-fire type enemy)
-Weapons and armours that have little diversity in terms of statistics. Would be nice to have some which provide magical bonuses, such as elemental effects like fire, water, holy magic, etc.
-Some quests and dungeons have game breaking bugs, which requires the player to reset progress at times. (Can be very frustrating for someone to lose progress, with the time lost being a few minutes or, if you are really unlucky, hours!)

Overall I still maintain that this game does have potential. I even upgraded my account to Dragon Guardian to help support the game and I do applaud the developers for what they accomplished so far. With more polishing of the game mechanics and taking out what doesn't work, this could one day be something more. I hope to one day change this review again, maybe even recommend it to other players.

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

The game is still in Early Access and we have much more to come in development so we understand your later points. We will be adding more narrative, gameplay and polish as we further develop the game.

We are also working on a new UI and improved UX that will help explain things in game more clearly, which may be what is causing some of your issues.

- We are unaware of any bugs with the monastery. The most likely cause for not being able to concede villagers is that you either do not have a dorm for them to live in or you don't have any unemployed men. You need both to be able to recruit monks.

- Some resources will deplete. Fishing spots are one of these so too many fishing huts might mean that there is no fish available from time to time. We are unaware of any issues affecting resources. 

- Villagers need housing zones within 150m of their workplaces but will travel any distance to get water, food and visit a church. There are no hard limits to needs fulfilling. This can affect their efficiency if they have to walk to far so managing these needs can be a priority,
There is a priority button for building projects as you say but we will look at the mechanics for this as we further improve the game.

If you are still having issues with any of the above then please could you send your save file to support@polymorph.games so that we can investigate further.

Cheers
Ash

The spectacle is fantastic, and makes it all worth it. The universe is thoroughly-crafted for what isn't just automatically-generated.

I played this for a very short bit when it was first released a few years ago, and with so much of the game leaning on the boring aspect of the apocalyptic dystopi , survival. It just kills the fun factor. There seems to be a huge disconnect with game devs and customers. It seems so simple to us, we want something well rounded. Base building without having to have an engineering degree, staying alive by eating random non rotten food, not having to make sure my blood sugar levels are okay or not. It seems like the people who make these games (which we all have really high hopes) are made by fringe gamers. They have extreme takes on existing titles instead of expanding on a fun, great working formula. Its not what you want, its what the customers want. And the customers want something straight forward, easy learning curve and that has longevity. Daz Mod had the perfect basic layout, and yet everyone else since than has to add their own wacky twist that nobody asked for. Its like the loudest voices are never the majority.

First of all, thank you for taking the time to write such an extensive review.

The realism you speak of was actually one of the draws of the game that led me to it, as a gamer first. It's a difficult thing to balance out in game dev, while still having the fun factor to it. The whole metabolism system you mentioned is still a main draw for players, and no other game has one like it, we're proud of that one. Still, it gets tested out thoroughly with every new feature and has seen QOL changes to it numerous times.
One of our top priorities is to balance out features so that they complement each other, that's why we depend on valuable player feedback up to the 1.0 release and beyond.

With the 0.95 update released, we're getting close to the polish phase where we'll seriously revisit all features in need of rebalancing and tune the hell out of them. 
But, these tiny improvements actually happen on a daily basis, through in-office communication and playtesting of the game.

While I do agree that a great existing formula is a good basis, we wanted to make our own special take on the whole genre and leave our own mark. 
We also believe that a game has to be fun, it's one of our top priorities and while it's also true that it's impossible to please everyone, our goal is to make the game more accessible to newcomers which is why we've added the CODEX in 0.95. A tutorial system which explains in-depth the features of SCUM.
A CODEX that will be also be expanded with 1.0 and beyond. 
We hope you'll give the game another chance and perhaps change your mind.
Have a good one!",513710

- Get the ball
- Pass to striker
- Shoot from outside box

The AI also plays with this same strategy. If it fails, try it again next turn. The game introduced  a few special skills that your players can learn. But often it feels very limited in terms of which skills which player can learn.

I think this game is a great effort, and I didnt experience bugs, but quality is lacking in areas besides production values.

As someone who wanted to like this game, I can't recommend it until the underlying design itself receives more polish.  The choice to use a full 3d map doesn't really seem to have paid off well.  Too many things are in the game that don't improve it, including UI buttons, mechanics, ships, technologies, etc.

Too many gameplay mechanics do not add to the experience, I believe these are things that seemed like good ideas but as currently implemented they detract from some combination of fun or intuitive-ness of the rules.  Not enough tools to deal with organizational challenges.  And the UI definitely has issues, a large amount of real estate sometimes is claimed to display very little information (though some windows are better designed than others)

I played on a harder difficulty and on my second game, I researched the first ship upgrade and took out a loan to buy 2, the AI players were no longer competitive after that (not that I would have understood why I was being out-competed with the current design) and I blew through a surprising amount of the tech tree with only two not-upgraded research stations.

This is the second review I have made for this product.  I voluntarily deleted the first because of some terribly vile comments that do not belong on this kind of platform.  This is a review for potential buyers of Colony Ship.  There are many good aspects to this game and I feel it shows great promise.  It has an interesting theme and story setting.  It also has some striking if simple graphics. At this time I say it is a poor purchase because of the value of play vs the cost.  In my opinion there is only a few hours of game play currently available.  Unless you want to play the first chapter over and over with different builds.  This brings me to the build options.  The game claims a variable system but I found that to be untrue.  If playing a Charisma/ Intelligence build it becomes formulaic and predictable.  Also, I do not feel you can actually get away without having some offensive capabilities.  I feel the combat system is erratic.  Cover, movement, and weapon stats are so completely unworkable that most fights are repeated over and over to achieve a positive result.  It is a combat grind.  Save, fight, save fight, until you win.  I do not find that enjoyable. Some have made the arguments that the game is meant to be a serious challenge and also that this is the nature of an ea game.  I actually agree with the second part except that of all ea titles I have this is the absolute bottom of the barrel in play ability.  I find it functionally unworkable in it's current form.  I have also questioned the way some of their developers communicate with their own customers.  I felt they came off rude and entitled but I understand they are a very small company (some said 3 people) so they may be very sensitive to criticism.  You would think it would motivate them to act in the opposite in an effort to cultivate more buyers.  As I said before I think it is currently a BAD purchase but it has GREAT potential to be an epic game.  Sadly I have turned off comments because of some of the things said by super fans.  I wish you all the best and happy gaming.  Months later and it is still going downhill fast.  I think my earlier hope that they would turn it into something good was wrong.

On one hand, I do like supporting devs whose games I enjoy, especially indie devs because the road can be really tough. On the other hand, there is not enough content (an hour at my reading speed) to justify its current price to me. 

The art style is unique and really gorgeous. The sound effects are very atmospheric. The backgrounds have a lot of little details that give them depth and vibrancy. What you see in the preview images is what you get – you have no save function, you cannot hide the text window, the amount of text window space seems disproportionate to the amount of text. 

What you don’t see – you cannot adjust text speed, there is no text history or going backwards if you click too quickly, switching between scenes (ie, when the auto-save function kicks in) can leave you with a black screen that requires reloading to progress (happened quite often for me for some reason but no one else seems to have mentioned it), so you end up replaying portions carefully when you finally realize that no amount of waiting is going to start a new scene.

I know this is Early Access so these are not recommendation killers for me. I am glad to support Pink Potion in this endeavour and I hope to see it become really successful; the game looks wonderful visually, the writing is intriguing and immersive such that I can identify with Jeong. 

However, and this is why I’m not 100% comfortable in recommending the game in its current state, there isn’t much content for the price that you pay. I feel like the current release is more suited as a demo, and even then, I’ve played demos longer than this current released episode. I also haven’t felt the non-immediate effects of my choices, so I look forward to seeing them come back to bite my shiny bum. If content is [i]not[/i] the main criteria that you look for, like me, this game is very much worth a try. Or maybe you'd simply like to support a budding dev. :)

I will, of course, be updating this review when I have the chance to experience more content (along with the new price point), which sounds like it will be soon. \o/",1535283863,1535283893,False,4,0,0.4964376389980316,0,True,False,True,False,,1539777654.0,"Hey Gievre and thanks for the detailed review, below are some developer comments:

UPDATE: Since your review, another chapter has been added to Yakuza Kiss and it triples the previous build game content. Further chapters will be released as soon as they are ready.

PRICE: As Yakuza Kiss is in Early Access, you are not paying simply for the content that is currently available - you get the entire game, including all future content (which will be substantial). We wish to reward early adopters and supporters and the current price is only a fraction of what the game will cost once it's completed.

SAVE SYSTEM: Currently the game utilizes an autosave system which is similar to what's been used in e.g. Tell Tale adventure games. Since we've had a lot of requests for a manual save system, that is in the works.

TEXT SPEED: You can adjust the text readout speed in the game options (options/game/text character speed). There is now also an autoread function that you can activate and you no longer have to click manually to progress.

BLACK SCREEN: We've had no previous bug reports of this issue, but we'll look into it. Could you please let me know if you still have this issue in our current 0.2 build?

I'd like to underline the fact that our team is very tiny and this project is pushing us to the very edge, but we're making it because we love what we do and we're hoping that players will see that and support us. We're in Early Access because we wish to develop the game together with players so it's essential that we know which features people wish to see in the final game. Feedback that is detailed and well-argued (such as in this review) really helps us, so please send us more of your thoughts via twitter, email or Steam forums.

You have to create a goal yourself with repetitive objectives that are always or almost always the same, and there's a moment where you hit the point of ""your robot does everything"", this means: Why creating a robot with complex mechanics when your shitty bot does the job without any problems ?

Slap a few weapons on it, eventually make a robot that has a magnet or drills with storage for mining and boom you're basically done. I've tried unlocking a few items that can make things a bit more funny logic gates and pistons and blocks that drop a missile and shit like that but the issue is that you finish the campain too fast and too easily with only a few chances to find those blocks that can help you make cooler bots that do different things. And like I said: you can have a correct bot that does everything in a few quests by unlocking stronger weapons that literally destroy the world.

And even worse than that, even if you get the opportunity to use those blocks and logic gates, I'm pretty sure that you will probably be better off using the typical weapons and drills bots than some massive bot with crazy stuff on it.

We are sorry to hear you are disappointed with the state of the game. I can assure you that multi-level building is one of our highest priority features to have implemented. It is where it is on the roadmap because from all of our community feedback it was determined that duplicating rooms was of a higher priority to our fans. 
We are aiming to have a content update every 1-2 months so features like multi-level building are not too far away.

I've played 426 frustrating hours of this game. I enjoyed some aspects of gameplay, but the majority of it has been terrible. Crafting is a NIGHTMARE (As explained in the below paragraph), Pay-to-win is a serious problem, and the story ends really badly. (In what would seem like the very middle of the story, with no proper ending, no more story stuff shows up. A bad guy is revealed, he escapes, and we don't go after him. BAD ending.) After a long time (I think more than half a year, but I logged in once 3 months ago to check if anything got better, so Steam can't tell me.) of not playing Crossout, I've realized that I've actually been happier rather than frustrated.

If you don't want to read my experience with this game, skip this paragraph to get to the details.
I used to love this game. It was absolutely amazing the first time I played, thinking of what I could make in the future. Eventually, I discovered that to make the vehicles I would want to make, it would take an absurd amount of money and time. Throughout the game I always played solo, so I never got a Clan, which is required for Relics. (Also, many of the vehicles I wanted to make wouldn't be possible at all, because the parts required don't exist. I once designed a faction to remedy this, hoping that I might be able to get the attention of developers and get at least some of the part concepts into the game. (I think that at this time it was naive to think this.)) Even though I discovered most things I wanted to build were nigh-impossible (w/o paying money), I decided to carry on playing in the hopes I could actually make something fun anyway. I was *mostly* wrong. (""mostly"" because I paid for two season passes: Doomsday Cars (because I had just started playing, so I was excited about it,) and The Syndicate. (Because of drifting wheels, a cabin to go with them, and the Kaiju weapon.)) After the Doomsday Cars season, I had a decent cabin (Cohort) to make a semi-decent vehicle. In PvP, I still got annihilated almost every time. Halfway through The Syndicate season, I decided that I would abandon the game after I finished the season pass. It was increasingly clear that the devs would never improve crafting, grinding, or anything else for the free-to-play players. (In fact, in the next season pass, they decided that Legendary stuff from that season could only be crafted during the season, making almost no-one able to get the legendary parts after the season without paying real money.) So I finally abandoned the game when the next season was announced.

For the sake of the math I already had done, here's a list of reasons I don't like Crossout: (Most of this I haven't edited at all.)

1) As rarities are sorted into Common (white), Rare (Blue), Special (cyan), Epic (Purple), Legendary (Yellow-orange), and Relic (Deep orange); there is a very steep increase in material cost in crafting Blue items. White items cost around 50 scrap and 10 copper, Blue items take around 700 scrap and 100 copper. Scrap is a very widely used resource, so you don't always have a lot. I typically have around 200 on average.
2) Crafting time is ridiculous. White items are crafted instantly. Blue are around 15 minutes. Cyan is 2 hours, Purple is 6 hours, legendary is 21 hours, and Relics are 5 days. This is just the time you have to wait after spending the materials!
3) To craft a Relic, you need 2 legendaries, which requires a total of 6 Epics (3 per L.), then 18 Specials (3 per E.), 36 Rares (2 per S.), and finally 72 commons (2 per R.). Each of these crafting tiers also requires a number of materials, making crafting something of a higher tier require sacrificing a number of items whose combined use is far more effective than the one higher-tier item. Based on if you only had to make the same item of each tier, you would need the following materials: 27,260 scrap, 10,312 copper, 3,000 wires, 1,300 plastic, 2,500 electronics, 2,500 batteries, 600 Uranium, and 243 hours of crafting time.
4) You obtain around 20 scrap for pvp victories, 15-ish copper for easy raids, 30-ish copper or plastic for normal raids, around 10 to 20 wires or batteries depending on the pvp mode selected, and almost nothing for ""Adventure"" mode. I've been unable to do others, as I can't survive hard raids (electronics or copper), and I don't have a clan for Clan Battles (Uranium, only source).
Using this information, it takes around 1,363 PvP wins in Get the Scrap Metal, around 688 easy raid wins for copper, 44 normal raid victories for plastic, 150 Get the Wires wins, 125 Get the Batteries wins, and an amount of wins that is unknown to me of Hard raids for electronics, and Clan battles for Uranium. You have to pay 500 in-game coins to make a clan. I have never been able to make 100 coins without a season pass in my 200 hours of gameplay.

Now here are some GOOD things about Crossout:
1) The vehicle builder is fun and effective to make interesting combat and interesting vehicles, if you can get enough parts.
2) Combat is usually fair between teams, the vehicle's total power score determining who you fight. (Although sometimes its hard when people come in with a powerful weapon on the bare minimum of a car.)
3) There is a semi-decent story.
4) The ""Adventure"" mode's map is really big, so you have plenty of places to go.
5) There are plenty of options for factions, even if some take forever to unlock. (It's taken 200 hours to get Nomads to level 10 and unlock the Dawn's Children, and get them to level 4.)

EDIT: I've realized that most Legendaries cost 5-7 Epics. I've done enough math, so I'm not gonna bother with rewriting the math. Just know that Relics are impossibly difficult to obtain.

Thanks for reading my review of Crossout. Crossout is a decent game with some incredibly obvious mistakes that make it hard to play. If these mistakes were corrected, and I actually do hope they are, then Crossout would be an amazing game. For a specific list of things that need fixing: Nightmarish crafting needs balance, free-to-play players need some form of means to beat pay-to-win players, the story needs an actual ending, and Relics shouldn't need Clans to access. I do hope this game gets to a playable state for free-to-play players, I would enjoy playing this game if it did.",1603737088,1632502571,False,0,0,0.0,0,False,False,False,False,,1605070713.0,"Hello.
All parts that affect to the battle can be obtain in-game ways: as the rewards for leveling up or you can buy them on the in-game market. So you don't need to spend any real money to buy a weapon, a cabin and so on.

Where Strangeland excels in telling its incredible narrative through the harrowing winds of a tempestuous madness, Primordia excels in delivering an equally provocative narrative through characters, worldpieces, and subtle messages told along the way that reveal a far darker, more sinister background to this bleak and dilapidated landfill we once dubbed Earth.

First off, I need to get this off my chest because I've waited nearly 3 years to say this: Primordia's aesthetic is jaw-droppingly, tear-jerkingly gorgeous to me. I sat for hours in the Unniic just listening to Metromind preach of the grandeur of her City of Glass and Light, and I wish I could go back to make those hours an eternity. Every dusty, broken-down heap, gilded with the faint remnants of a false life, flickering with the melancholy flakes of a binary will that inches to survive; it all was just so haphazardly beautiful to me that it lingered in my psyche for years to come. I think it goes without saying, but the art direction that these games receive is some of the best in the indie industry.

There are a TON of things I'd love to talk about in this review, but I just don't have the time, so I'll limit it to this: Primordia is the first game I've ever played to make me truly question if the antagonist is truly a villain or not. Metromind is a character masterclass on how to truly maroon your audience in the limbo of their own morality. And don't mishear me: other video game antagonists, such as Gwyn, Lord of Cinder from Dark Souls or The Pale King from Hollow Knight, make it perfectly clear that they are morally grey; that have done equally good and bad things and that characterizing them as hero or villain is, at best, shortsighted and foolish. But halfway through her monologues at the peak of the tower, I was seriously questioning whether or not Metromind was truly unjust in both her actions and her ideals, and if I was the fool all along. She's characterized by many to be an authority-hungry power-junky, but if she really wanted to hoard power, she would never have created a city where robots could thrive and never worry about energy usage. She bans religion, and the act of leaving the city, but the robots she cares for just don't know any better. They don't understand that if they leave the city, they'll likely perish in the dunes, or if they worship Man, then they will become preaching slaves to ideals that staunch the act of progress; the very ideal that Metropol runs off of. Every action she took had me question what would truly be the best course of action if NOT that: Either steal the power-sources from outside the dunes and neutralize any hostility in your way, or let Metropol slowly bleed out without the means to provide for its citizens. Either usurp the regents and adjudicators that once held the city together, or let all perish in the wake of your humility. Either stop Horatio and Crispin from taking what's theirs, or let them have it so they can die in silence amidst the nil. It's SOOO interesting, and lingered in my system years after I had completed the game. Because of that ALONE, this game enters my top 10 favorites, and I don't feel a shred of doubt saying that.

Where other mechanical medias focus so much on the age-old, beaten-to-death question, ""What does it mean to be Human[?]"", Primordia pushes far past that to the point of no return; to a world where we had our chance, and failed, and naught but the scattered shrapnel of that failure remains in our wake, asking us with sorrow, ""What remains of Humanity when we are gone?""

While the game's attention to detail and innovative features are admirable, it's essential to address two significant issues: poor frame rates and the impact of overly detailed ""jiggle physics"" on the female character models.

One of the main concerns for me revolves around SCUM's performance in terms of frame rates. The game's demanding graphics and physics simulations can strain even high-end gaming systems, resulting in sub-optimal frame rates. This issue can severely hinder the overall gaming experience, causing frustration and detracting from the immersive survival atmosphere that SCUM aims to create. This notable in the latest release which along with low frame rates suffers from late object drawing.

To address the frame rate concerns, the developers could consider additional game optimisation. This might involve refining resource-intensive graphical elements, tweaking the rendering pipeline, or providing additional graphics settings to allow players to tailor the game to their hardware capabilities. Frequent updates have been forthcoming from the developer so there is ample opportunity to roll out improvements.


While SCUM strives for realism in its character models, the implementation of overly detailed ""jiggle physics"" on female characters can contribute to distracting and unrealistic visuals, particularly during intense gameplay moments.

To address this concern, the developers might consider implementing an option in the settings menu that allows players to adjust or disable the jiggle physics effect to their own tastes and system capabilities. Providing players with the ability to customise their gaming experience in this manner would strike a balance between realism and player preference, ensuring a more inclusive and enjoyable environment for all players.",1707346040,1707346040,True,1,2,0.5,0,True,False,True,True,,,,513710

We are really sorry to inconvenience you and other players with being insistent about the 2-step authentification, but it's really the best way to protect you from phishing scams and other ways of  someone getting an unauthorized access to your accounts.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. One of these are completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate
- Entirely new Skirmish AI

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

If you have spare week to get decent spawn near must have ores, engines are still total crap ad I need literaly hundreds of then for any bigger ship, I wont even mention mulltiplayer as it was so bad that I even do not play it anymore. 
Anyway this is just my opinion. 

PS. New color scheme for ores are also nightmare.

Edit: And yea Keen, you had plenty of time to ""help me"", now I am rewriting my opinion just to warn people of your game, but some people like to suffer, so choice is on them :)

Edit 30.06.2022: I must edit my review as I play it again so despite all it's fallbacks, I guess it is very nice and enjoyable to play, once I change my building aproach. I will still say that engines are crappy with their poor power, which requires whole nacelles and half of ship overed in engines to make it fly decently, but that is engineering problem to solve right? Anyway, I will say positive and low DLC price is nice bonus.

Edit 13.2.2023: I decided to try and play again to see if any of stuff i hated in game got fixed or at least eased if that is possible. So in short nope. New bugs, along with old ones. My game crashes and tart spinning in circles almost every 2-3 plays. Engines are still ginormous but they still can't power ship even if they want to. What ever design I try without mods I need at least 1/2 up to even 2/3 of my ship to be engines. Nope i am done...again. I even am not sure what I was expecting i guess.
Edit: 23.6.2023. I tried to play again due to pure boredom. So i said to myself if I accept fact that all above is as is, will i be able to play? Well answer is as expected...no. I made small bump with atmospheric engine during docking and whole engine exploded and disintergated. Lovely.

As EVERYONE is saying the AI is...potato at best. Let me explain.

1. People will stand idle for days at a time.  Need your biologists to maintain plants? nah they're gonna hang in this tunnel and O2 generator for awhile.  Need your Medic to use a ""medical supply"" on a injured colonist? nah they're gonna sleep, eat, cross the entire map to take ore to the metal processor INSTEAD OF HEALING THE WORKER WHO FRANKLY IS WAAAAY MORE IMPORTANT.
2. Everything is suicidal - Oh sandstorms here that hurts our health and incapacitates robots? well our omnipresent lord and master hasnt built a control center to put a yellow alert up so LETS GO OUSIDE! *dies/KOs*
3.  Food disappears super suddenly because you cant really tell how much food is needed to feed people - For example 10ish people with a small biodome making food and you have a surplus of 40+ vegetables.  11 people? HAHA everyone gets to starve now! Prioritizing doesnt help either as that doesnt effect production time just keeping the growing plants healthy.
4. Power dissapears all to quickly at night unless you've somehow managed to mass produce STUPID amounts of Backup batteries.  Solar power doesnt work at night (duh) and I can accept that, but wind is SOOOO underpowered.  Right before nighttime the wind never fails to stop...completely and then the batteries drain at uberspeed, especially when you have just gotten a start in expanding.  5 buidings OK at night 6? Yeah...well good luck with that.  Again you could just place more solar and generators during the day but it takes DAYS for the AI to get around to building Metal from ore.
5.  Prioritizing anything is luck at best.  Need starch (for plastic) well unless you happen to have extra resourses laying around for a med or large biodone then you have to sacrifice food.  Need Medical plants? yup same deal you sacrifice food and starch (for plastic).

Now the AI...it just doesnt seem to want to work with you.  you can have recources available and people will just loiter forever.  The only thing I see to fix it is to unprioritize everything, stop building, and wait for every loose item to be gathered and taken to its home.  Then AND ONLY THEN will a medic heal a person or a engineer/robot go build a building.  Heck the builder robot routinly does the carry robots job while the carry robot just idles around.  It seems like the AIs prioritizing is alittle off deeming gathering over healing or expansion. 

So why do I also recommend it? Now maybe this is just because of the finicy AI but mistakes are punished.  Your building an outpost ona distant planet you cant just be given everyhting super easy, though a few extra resources in the colony craft woudnt be harmful.  The models are pretty nice if a little lacking in variety.  The game doesnt slog along, once you start you (logicaly) only have a short while to get oxygen, water and food going. Though itd be nice if either you had more food or people didnt have black holes for necessities.  The core mecanics are there and the game has good foundations, its just a wait to see how they do with newer content. 

Improvement wise there needs to be some more movement of parts.  Sure the solar panels turn and wind turbines turn but oxygen? nah static movement, water? nope? food? nope, just spits out veggies and such occasionally.  Rooms are just that, rooms theres nothing amazing about them to make you zoom in and marvel at whats happening.  I just watch the resources and when theres enough I build a building.  Which is bad as im not LOOKING at the game, just teh charts and resource monitors, the game could have been a top down or ASCII game for the amount of time ive looked at things.  Rooms should be specialized when you build them imo, biodome? select food, startch, or medical plants and then upgrade it over 4 levels 1/4 full, 2/4 full etc and have it fill with various things.  Have some airducks that have little streamers blowing to show air is present, have the med bay bed perform diagnostics on a injured person.  have water spriklers in the biodome.  This would need some more balancing to make it not game wrecking but showers and toilets as apparently hygene isnt important in space. maybe mine more then ore like precious metals to trade.  Theres so much room for improvement but I think that the resources need a major overhaul first as anything gets added to this game and it might make everything break.  Especially since everything is based on 2 singular things, metal and bioplastic, the amount needed just to get stuff rolling is crazy even if its just 1 or 2 of each.

Still, idk, I like this game but I know that its only...20% if that.  The base game is there but is in need of balancing and additional things to do as honestly the game relies alittle to much on luck atm.  Also once the AI gets tweaked im sure this will get much better.  Heres to hoping the gtame isnt just dropped by the producers.  

Id give this a 5.5-6/10.  Playable and just fun enough to not drive you insane.",1445211215,1445211215,False,3,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,1461366556.0,"Hi there,

Elite is a space sim that requires a bit more imagination by players, as the upgrade-loop you have in most games does not totally apply here. Sure you can go and upgrade your ship and get better stuff and shoot things or earn billions with trading, exploration or mining apart from combat, but what makes Elite so great is the actual experience. There's a plethora of player groups, squadron and role play communities that simply are in for the fun. Saving players who ran out of fuel mid-transit, killing evildoers or robbing players when a trading event is on is as fun as doing the more traditional stuff. It has a 1:1 scale galaxy, a very well done flight model, insanely good sound design and every venue of gameplay except piracy is profitable. They even made the DLC-content free, so everyone can land on planets now and have SRV-races on a 0.2g planet. So you go out there, explore, shoot, trade, and do your thing. Meet other players, make some friends, and wait for space legs so we can explore, shoot and meet some more.

One of the biggest problem with this game is its maps. It is procedurally generated and in many instances, it is not actually playable due to haphazard generation of mountain tiles; which also makes city development extremely difficult.

Another big problem is the load time and initialization time of the game; one has to wait for a long time to load a game. The unit roster and combat mechanics is OK and immersing enough.

The technology tree is without much depth, in fact compared to other 4X games, it is almost non existent in terms of the aspects it covers. The game apparently has all the required components for an engaging game-play but the components are somehow not meshed together properly or are in a very rudimentary stage.

Another big problem is the city management screen; the map in this screen can be zoomed in and out but not moved. This becomes a tremendous problem as city development in this game largely tend to be lopsided and seem to be extended in one direction due to the mountain issue mentioned above.

I found the game very strange in that at micro level it has every thing (exploration, resource management, map, tech tree, combat), yet at macro level (overall game level) it does not have the depth, game-play, tactics and it feel very empty.

Since the game is in EA, hope is that developers would correct some of the flaws. At this point it is not worth investing money in the game, one should wait or all together skip this title.

One thing does need to be mentioned and highlighted. The developers have done a fantastic job in terms of the stability of the game. It is rock solid and has not crashed or become slow for once in my entire play-through.

buy it on sale 10-15 dollars, especially if you are ok with rust, and like zomboid. If you can't make it past the initial huge learning curve you won't waste too much money.


Longer review-
Recommending was a toss up. There is so much potential it is insane, and I do ultimately enjoy it, but there is a lot to unpack. 

Scum is the love child of Rust and Project Zomboid. Like Zomboid it has a steep learning curve. Very steep. If you are learning on your own, I estimate 50 hours if you have limited similar experiences to really have a grasp on how to survive, assuming you are learning most of the game and not skipping things.

Like Rust there is raiding and pvp, but it heavily depends on the server. Make no mistake 60 people on 1 server at once is a lot. Once you have the basics down, you can largely simplify the game if you please. You can sustain yourself on a simple diet, and you don't have to build or farm, and making money becomes easier. Many players live off of stashes they place in world and are baseless.

The way I see it the devs care about the game, but not about the players. This deserves further explanation. There are basically 0 quality of life features. If you want basic wood arrows, you need to cut sticks into small stick, then craft each arrow. Find a box of nails? Have fun right clicking and then left clicking remove nail for the next few minutes. That isn't fun, it is work. 

To add insult to injury there used to be faster ways to do it, like being able to craft a nail with the required material being a box of them, but that was removed for some reason. It is a simple recipe, it wouldn't take an hour to code it in from scratch, and if you just used a form it would take minutes. 

To make things a little more aggravating you need dozens if not hundreds of nails, bolts and bobby pins, which means you are unpacking for an hour of two if you do it all at once. Again, this is work, not fun. Further, your first base will likely be made with primitive gear, which means a simple 2x2 can take hours. 

Not very much is intuitive either, so it can be VERY frustrating. There are even keyboard commands that arent shown on the keybindings, which should piss anyone off. Because of this the game ultimately feels like the devs don't respect the players time which explains why the game is on life support.

In my experience official servers are more toxic than Rust official. The main reason is feuding. Some people hold grudges in rust, but the reality is that in rust there is usually such a high pop that are all doing the same thing, that people forget because in 30 minutes it happened again 2-3 times. Sometimes it goes further but I have yet to hear about long time players holding a grudge more than a day or two without a specific reason, like racism etc. Scum servers have to be smaller, so people will try to punish you specifically often. While this can be fun if it is a friendly competition, most people who are new don't want to deal with that. Ever have someone find all your bases and only raid you and constantly hunt for specifically you, before you were really established? I have it sucks, and there was literally nothing I could do. I was prim, and he had rifles. Why? apparently I built my first base too close to him, but I had no idea where he was. Maybe 2 hours in on my first time loading.

The actual gameplay is great, the animations are really good, plenty of things to do if you just want to learn playing solo. I do find the shooting to be the most accurate to real life than in any game I have ever played, with there being a bullet rise before drop, windage etc. So sniping can be really complicated compared to most other games, and in one case I hit a friend in the head with a shot at over a grid away. Unfortunately most servers wont have draw distance that high, but hey that happened and it was awesome. The hunting is incredibly hard, and the best way I can describe it is like spot and stalk irl, which isn't practiced a lot, and is quite difficult, harder than irl to be honest. Anyone who hunts knows hunting is not easy either. The fishing is fun. PVP is fast, as in incredibly fast. 1-2 shots and it is likely over, and even if you win, you could still die from the injury or infection. That is why server pops can not be too high.  

The game can be very fun after the learning curve, and there are many people who are helpful, and nice (relatively speaking, don't ask where their base is and they wont say goodnight). The online tutorials are ok, but until you figure it out do yourself a favor and start on a pve server. The game is immensely different than any other I have found, and you will need time to acclimate to it",1701992502,1701992502,True,157,2,0.927491784095764,0,True,False,True,True,,,,513710

Camera controls will be improved during development however we aren't aware of a bug that causes the camera to get stuck in a top down view.

Right after the release the game was quite challanging as the feedback from tyles was more realistic and it was easier to crash.

Last upgrades showed that Milestone dont want to keep the game realistic, and prefer to focus on more arcadish game play. Its sad because if someone want  more realism the game starts to get boring after some time. Bikes are very stable, the feedback of tyres is very high and also you can press the brake in full lean and bike will not instantly crash...

What I like about game:
-great onboard experience
-pitobards
-tyre compound simulation
-multiplayer lobbies
-helmet, number, back patch customisation
-MotoE!

What I dislike:
-arcadish physics with big amount of feedback and grip
-lack of option to lock onboard in online races
-no ride through penalty
-no damage to the bike

5 years playing and participating with the community to help creating this game, giving feedback, suggestions, ideas, bug reports, and all that stuff you do when you enter an Early Access project. Maybe some of you knows that I have been making tons of videos of Space Engineers. Although, my channel was terminated recently, due to some community violations BS, that some people suspect it was a network inside job conspiracy theory.
Anyways... There was glorious, impressive moments, amusement, but also rage, disappointing, delusions, etc. You can't have everything. But since I am not an MP kind of guy, at least in this type of games. I didn't feel that part of the community rage, I know it was bad though. So, I only played and enjoyed very much the Creative and Survival since the beginning, of course always wanting to have more stuff and things to ask Devs to add to the game, but as I said, we can't expect them to add everything we ask for, right?
The Survival mode for sure needs a revamp, I know you can add tons of mods or play a custom scenario. But a core new feature would be 100 times better, and for some reason I preffer the game Vanilla as possible. I love mods of course, an also think some of them should be in the game core as essential. 
Even the Creative mode needs improvements, in the way that there is a few blocks that seems to be missing. Particulary corners blocks, mechanical blocks, and perhaps a few aesthetic blocks. Again, ""there is amod for that"". I know dooooh!
But know, the MP part, which I repeat I am not particulary interested in, it has been Updated. A massive marathonic work from Keen to fix the MP once and for all. of course, I tried it, and I just... it blowed my mind. 30-40-60 people in one server, all together, almost no lag, no desync, no rubberbanding. I mean, if you compare this New Multiplayer from 2-3 years ago, this is for sure a huge improvement, it even makes me want to join MP or Coop servers now.
Anywas, ending this text wall, now. 
TL;DR do not expect a very rich Survival solo game (unless the surprise us with a New Survival Overhaul Soon(tm)), or a mega massive online space battle. The game is very hardware demanding, since it have phiycs and stuff. But don't be afraid to search the workshop, there are great mods there that will make this experience way more enjoyable, and game modes, custom scenarios, other people's creations as well.",1532168677,1532168677,True,5,1,0.5484200716018676,0,True,False,True,False,,1532172564.0,"SpetS, thank you very much for this review and the feedback.

Want a class? Do a daily for about 8 days to unlock it.
Want a cosmetic set? Do a daily for like a dozen or so days to unlock one part of the set of 8 equipment.

Want some event items? Pray to RNGesus and keep killing what was supposed to be some important boss multiple times in a row.
Want to level up? Grind about 5 times more than the usual normalcy of MMOs (and I'm talking about Runescape/Everquest [and no I'm not talking about maxing things, I'm talking about leveling up combat]).
Want to continue the plot? Do the same exact ""Kill X, Y times to collect A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/etc."" mission with a blurb or two to justify needing to kill the same exact monster again instead of just killing it beforehand and gathering more than one bear ass from the same corpse before going back to the bear ass fetishist to get the same bear ass again.

The fun part is you can make grinding fun, like in horde games like PoE/BDO or make the rpg combat reactive like in ESO/TSW/Neverwinter/Dragon Age Origins (even if it doesn't outweigh the pain of the grind at least have SOMETHING entertaining about your games other than lore puns), but the daily limit, the spawn rates of both monsters AND items, and the merge shop just makes this MMO less of a game and more of a chore.

I paid 50 bucks to be entertained, not to do chores. 
Speaking of, 50 bucks packs in a ""beta"" spanning years is a huge warning sign. Still kicking my own ass over that decision.

Dailies are a small part of the game and optional and there are no artificial caps. Caps are in place to keep the game fair and balanced. Any 'grinding' is also optional and the devs are reworking many quests to lessen the grind. 

If a player does want a different class than the base classes, that is also optional and they can choose to work to earn it (and learn about the class) or can pay DCs outright. 

There are some items in the game that are random drops and are a challenge to get. This is another optional feature of the game, as items can be obtained in multiple ways.

AQ3D is free to play, and purchasing any packages are also completely optional. You don't need to pay $50 to be entertained and what players want to do or have it the game is their choice. The game is in Open Beta and any rewards Guardians receive are all available except the Guardian Tower features which are in progress. The devs just posted this update about the Nature Guardian Tower on May 11th - https://aq3d.com/news/art_sneek_peek/.

The devs are constantly working on fixing and improving issues and releasing updates/patches weekly. This has been a constant balance as an indie game company with a small staff. Please check out the Game Plan and Design Notes for updates - https://aq3d.com/news/ & https://aq3d.com/game-plan/.

AQ3D is definitely not like other MMOs - our company has never played by the normal 'rules' of creating games - we like taking risks, doing crazy events and releases and love using puns. We are definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but will continue to release fun, exciting, wacky and memorable content.",429790

As a Monomyth developer posted below this review, this game has changed a lot since it's release and since I wrote this review. While I do not currently have time to give the game another shot due to classes, keep in mind that the review below is not an accurate reflection of the current version of Need to Know.
[/quote]

So I tried to like this game, I really did, and I was one of the ones who followed the hype from the first trailer release in the Kickstarter campaign. I really looked forward to the Papers, Please -eqsue surveillance game that the trailers advertised. Holding out to release (remember, no pre-orders!), however, revealed some key flaws that the game has.

[h1]Lack of Tutorial[/h1]
The lack of a tutorial is my primary issue with Need to Know. With almost zero instruction given, the player has no clue on how to progress, how to use the different tools provided in-game, and what distinguishes a subject between a ""safe"" individual and a threat. Players are expected to know beforehand what all the tools do and how to use them effectively, and  with the game not arming the players with that knowledge, I and many others were left confused as to what to do almost constantly.

[h1]User Interface[/h1]
The current user interface is extremely similar to the user interface that was advertised throughout the developer cycle. While it seems to be extremely sleek and inviting, don't let its looks fool you. The UI was another primary issue with Need to Know. In practice, the UI was sluggish and huge on-screen, with every single element in each window being blown up unnecessarily. Everything except any back or close indicators, which took minutes to find on several occasions. In the beginning of the game, it even took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to begin the first mission! 

[h1]Final Evidence is not consistent with Evidence Requirements[/h1]
At the beginning of each mission, you are given specific key evidence to look out for while analyzing individuals. Several times, the evidence the game wanted me to find were inconsistent with the requirements it gave me. This meant I often “missed” evidence which was never actually listed as a requirement.

[h1]Inconsistent Results after Missions[/h1]
As part of the story, you need to build up your agency's trust in you by successfully analyzing, identifying key elements a suspect might exhibit, and eventually classifying the subject as safe or a threat. These trust points given, however, were often inconsistent. Successfully classify and identify all pieces of evidence in a mission? Have 15 trust points! Missed one piece of evidence? There goes 30 points!

[h1]Inconsistent Dialogue[/h1]
Have a bad day and lose a lot of trust points? Doesn't matter, your boss will let you know what a great job you did today!

[h1]Bugs and Glitches[/h1]
While many people (such as myself) disregard the bug warnings in games and play them anyway only to still have a positive experience, let me tell you that it is not the case with this game. Throughout playing, I experienced numerous bugs, some of which were game breaking or needed a restart. For example, after losing in the prologue (why is that even possible?) and making a new profile the game glitched out and showed two different points in the story, progressing through them simultaneously, requiring a full restart of the game and clearing out the old profile and creating a new profile. Notifications on your in-game phone often appear and disappear in under a second, not giving you enough time to read what it says. You can’t even change the wallpaper.

[h1]In Conclusion[/h1]
In its current state, I cannot recommend Need to Know. The game has vital problems that it needs to solve, problems so important that it makes you wonder if Monomyth Games even play-tested all the features in-game before the final release, in despite of several beta versions being released to Kickstarter backers in the previous months. The game feels like a rushed beta version, even though the game was delayed by a month. Should Monomyth Games fix these key issues, I would gladly re-purchase the game for another shot at Need to Know.",1535506613,1541276379,False,66,0,0.7627779841423034,7,True,False,False,False,,1540185990.0,"Hi, we’re glad you followed Need to Know so closely, and are sorry that it disappointed you upon release. We appreciated your thorough, clear review, and have since worked hard to address many of the issues you raised.

[h1]Lack of Tutorial[/h1]
Tutorials are now in place for key points in the game, particularly in the opening sequences. Gameplay is now also more clearly directed, and will continue to improve.

[h1]User Interface[/h1]
Our UI scaling now sets all windows much smaller as a default, and allows you to adjust the size with a slider to fit your preferences, which helps to minimize visual clutter. We can see how the interface was initially confusing, but with the new tutorials and more visual guidance, you should find that this issue has been heavily remedied.

[h1]Final Evidence is not consistent with Evidence Requirements[/h1]
Thanks to our helpful, enthusiastic community, we’ve corrected the vast majority of these inconsistencies. Although some may still be lurking around, they should now be negligible, and we’re working to root them out as soon as they’re reported. 

[h1]Inconsistent Results after Missions[/h1]
Although the Department of Liberty is an unforgiving organization that does not tolerate mistakes, we understand that the point deductions may have been harsh (particularly when coupled with unclear gameplay). We’ve rebalanced the Compliance system, so that you won’t be punished as heavily for errors. 

[h1]Inconsistent Dialogue[/h1]
We agree that this issue would have been immersion-breaking! Since release, we’ve expanded dialogue branches in most post-mission conversations so that NPCs now react more accurately to your performance. Your boss will no longer pat you on the back for a terrible work performance. 

[h1]Bugs and Glitches[/h1]
We have fixed major, game-breaking bugs and addressed a host of minor issues that made the experience far more burdensome than it needed to be. The glitches you experienced should now be long-gone, and you can no longer be booted from the Department after the opening interview sequence. Though it was possible to re-load the game at this point, this was not clear enough, resulting in some players replaying the entire intro, which would have been irritating.
Also, you can change your phone wallpaper, and we’ll soon be adding a much larger range!

You and other reviewers are right in pointing out the game’s flaws on release, and we appreciate that you managed to be constructively critical without any malice. Since launch though, we’ve worked very hard to correct these problems, and in the future, will continue to make the game richer and more complex. For example, we’re currently implementing financial pressures, and more choice-based outcomes for home missions.

If you do get a chance to try the game again, and you encounter any issues you'd like to let us know about, you can head over to the Steam discussions or our Trello board [url=https://trello.com/b/ABG1gSZb/need-to-know-bugs-feature-requests]here[/url], and we'll fix it as soon as we can!

We really hope you give Need to Know another shot, and that your second experience is much more closely aligned with your expectations. Thanks for your time!",490930

In the end, it comes down to a relaxing gameplay loop of you vs physics. The game does not tell you much about how things work, yet it also tells you everything in the details. It's just so many details and systems that it is very intimidating at start.
Don't expect clear health bars or exact states of everything. And that is really cool the way it is, after all you spectate the ship from a drone far away - with all the sensor interference and whatnot.
It is this unknown that drags one in and this captures the look and feel of a space mining operation very well.

On one side, the game is rather simple and easy. You fly around, shoot rocks, collect cargo, get back to base, repair, upgrade, repeat.
On the other hand, it can be beautifully difficult if you run full speed into the fields or follow some of the quest lines.

The game gets really frequent updates, the demo was just patched to be basically a full version so you can donate the cash to people who need it more in these times.

Indeed, some aspects may have serious bugs or flaws. But definitely not ""everything"".

This is a complex game with many complex features, so it is not an easy task to create a comfortable user interface and tutorial for each aspect of the game.
But we are constantly working on improvements of usability and fixing the most critical bugs. Currently there is not so many of them actually. Earlier the game was really bugged, but now we are fixed most of critical bugs. The rest of them will be solved pretty soon.

Yet its intrusive jokes just keep right on coming, every five seconds, completely confident in themselves, but still not funny. At times I could barely concentrate on what I was doing because the unfunny comedy man would not stop talking to me. It got to a point where I was just kinda boringly floating around space looking for material that I couldn't find anywhere. I looked it up in the guide and that wasn't helping. I floated around, slowly, tediously, for like two hours trying to find one mat. I was gonna just google it but then I decided I'll probably just play something else.

Aside from managing and expanding your base (energy, food, housing etc.) you go outside, exploring Titan with your rover or on foot; gathering data, ressources and information. You spend it on research and  supplies. You find people to connect and trade with; like a Chineese base, a trader from a free enterprise, your home crew and some more. 

You got to develope your charakter, RPG style, and have to decide on which abilities you spend your xps; for you can´t level em all to max during one play-through; and each skill provides you with the means to complete the quests for one of the factions; each delivering a different ending.

Hope you'll be back for future updates!"" ~El Oshcuro August 7th 2019

Since then not a single feature I noted as missing has been added and not a single update for Maximum Action has happened. But the devs did announce a new game to add to the pile of stuff their developing. Behavior like this is why I detest Early Access game design. If you want a good example of how it should look go look at Postal 4 or Overgrowth. Games were the dev team was commited to them and focused all there efforts on a single game. They also published frequent updates and in the case of Overgrowth have a  400+ video youtube playlist showcasing every single build of the game. I wouldn't buy this game again and I certainly would not recommend that you buy it either. At this point it seems like the devs have abandoned Maximum Action in favour of their more popular titles Amid Evil and Dusk. 

Original review:

As with most early access games I can barely call it a game. Yes theres mechanics, levels too, and some of them can be quite fun but a ""Game"" is something that can be won or lost, and often theirs a progression from start to end.

Maximum Action doesn't really have this, no high score boards or story, no unlocks. No progression at all. You start with full acess to everything and it makes the game feel empty. Like cheating for a full weapon set and unlimited money in GTA. It makes the whole game feel completely uninteresting and I have no reason to bother playing it. No achievements, levels, weapons or skins to unlock.

Maximum Action seems to be banking on user generated content but unless your game has a huge fanbase you're not going to get far banking on the modding/steam workshop scene to carry your game. Always the games with the largest workshops/modding scenes have been games like Left 4 Dead or Skyrim. Games that were around LONG before the workshop was a thing and almost everyone who has a PC has played them. 

Maybe this game might be worth it if its on sale. But for 20 bucks I find myself hesitant to recommend it.  

Overall buy with caution and know what your getting into, like most Early Access games its not worth it and probably wont ever be.

May 8th 2020: Still none of the content I asked for is here, we have one new level though. So yeah the game is pretty much abandoned and left to rot in Early Access.

After coming back to give it another shot I'm going to write a sort-of good one.


Firstly, they've fixed a lot of the issues I had back then (UI issues like the call to arms dot being a tiny thing that was hard to click on, total lack of useful mouseover information, massive glitches)


Secondly as I got further into it I started to appreciate the thought that has gone into it. And particularly the new mechanics that weren't in the original dungeon keeper. A lot of them make sense when considered, like seperating the DK1 horned reaper ""strong creature thats hard to keep happy"" and DK2 horned reaper ""endgame summon monster"" into two seperate monsters, the vampire and titans. Or giving a means to assign creatures to the peaceband, so they work instead dropping everything to following the call to arms spell. Smart.


(Tip for anyone coming from DK1 and 2: Dont try to build 5 x 5 rooms immediately like you used to be able to in that game. Theres so many rooms and less space to build them in so its worth planning what you need for the level and starting with a 3x3.


Also I highly ecommend you slow down the game speed, which is a stock option thankfully.)


But it still has one MAJOR issue though, the difficulty curve. You're either storming though the level fairly easily or you're hitting a brick wall (level 4 with its unending waves smacks you out of nowhere after a fairly easy first few levels) it really lacks the twists and surprises that Bullfrog designed levels had. 


Pretty much every level has an infinite gold seam, so once you find that, you dont have to budget anymore. Plus you have the option of gold potions, turning your enemies to gold, a spell that literally just gives you gold for temporarily mana etc. 


Its too many get out of jail free cards. Again in the old bullfrog games they werent afraid to occasionally lock you out of some of your abilities, to force you to change strategy. 


Maintaining a dungeon is really easy since creatures dont fight internally anymore, not even converted hero units. I dont think I ever once had creatures complaining about food even with a 3x3 pig farm feeding a massive dungeon. 

Lava only seems to sort-of burn creatures, and plenty of them just dont care anyway. I got the stone bridge well before ""how do I cross this lava"" ever even became a problem I'd thought about solving.

DK1 and 2 you could NEVER rebuild earth. So once it was mined you were exposed for good. Here you get a spell to do that easily. 


See where I'm going with this? The game gives you a bunch of abilities, maybe too many abilities, but rarely tests your brain with them. 

The two suddenly-actual-difficult levels where I had to actually think and strategise were the ones I enjoyed the most.

It adds up to a fun DK flavoured novelty, but one without an engaging challenge. If steam had that option I'd give it half a thumbs up.",1484323170,1484324146,True,9,0,0.5831524729728698,0,True,False,False,False,,1484336809.0,"Thanks for the re-review and really pleased to hear that all our work over the past nearly two years has helped to change your perception of the game.

Missing a few features still, seems a very young title, no septic for fertilizer makes no sense sort of thing, and no enemy ai attacking the base yet, not sure if its a planned feature but should be.

The game itself though is tricky at first, I killed 100 odd colonists learning and started 10 odd new games doing it, but once you figure the mechanics out its very enjoyable to build a huge base and balance its many different systems.
The graphics are sweet, neat and colorful, the sandstorms need work though, very bland at the moment, you can zoom into all buildings and build things into each building after you have constructed the building itself, it requires you ''deck out'' each room so to speak, or its just an empty room, you can build big bases or small, it doesnt force you to have a huge base you can run a small existance if you like, but the real challenge is in a massive base, it has trade ships, colonist ships, visitor ships, all come and you can interact with the trade ships and buy and sell anything you make, which is great, radio scope, tele scope, radar, etc all work, all the systems inside buildings worked for me, I have experience ZERO bugs with this new release, given I have a very high spec PC, that is still very rare on new games to be so bug free, very impressed at the sole developers efforts so far, if he sticks with it and expands on the game he has here I beleive he will make a pretty penny from this project, overall I give the game a big thumbs up for such an early release, even though the game itself isnt that big yet, it is sound in how it works.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2017. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. One of these is completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate
- Entirely new Skirmish AI

This game is a fine example of what happens when a developer has a huge ambition to create a game but disregard the design and needs from the players point of view; complete disaster.

The game started on a tutorial island and already you can see there are actually plenty of features and contents. The rune mechanic is also fresh as unlocking chests require some kind of puzzle. The weapon system goes so deep there are binded cursed weapons already in the tutorial.

However, this game lacks in presenting these features to the players and interaction between players and the game is kept at minimal. Example, I spent minutes looking for the captain as presented in the hint box but he was just right beside me where I started because hovering my mouse over NPCs does not glow nor have any hint that they can be interact with. The example is just a small insight of how vague the game can be.

If you are a hardcore patient gamer who are really into RPG perhaps this would be nice. I don't know how the story goes but dialogue are voiced over so that is pretty awesome.

Every other things such as graphics, character creation and customization, inventory, minimap, camera controls and etc are mediocre. Nothing to shout about but its there, plain and simple and ready to be utilized.",1477032420,1477032420,False,10,0,0.6162469387054443,0,False,False,False,False,,,,316370

Gameplay
Graphics
Sound

Cons:
Inability to use controller on the menus
No Linux support

Overall:
My judgements are based on the free version. Product page was a bit misleading, showing that the only difference between free and paid was maps and acheivements, but the use of single player bots is locked behind a pay wall. 

Either way, as someone who loved the early 2000's shooters (unreal tournament, etc), I find this game is a nice tribute to that era with modern graphics and effects before Call of Duty single-handedly lowered the entire Gaming communities IQs by a large margin.

[quote]Installs extra crap on my PC[/quote]

The setup installs only the game. However, Unreal Engine might install some ""missing"" run-time components and prerequisites. This is particularly true, if you currently have no other Unreal Engine based games installed.

There are no extra programs, bloatware or other BS installed with Toxikk. Just the game and its prerequisites (if missing).

This ISN'T Subnautica in space, or a beautiful-but-haunting exploration-survival game like Adr1ft. 

What is IS is a game with an extremely small amount of content. Without even trying, you can beat the game in an hour to an hour and a half. And thats it... no replayability due to the lack of content either.

All you do is collect a few resources, make your way to a waypoint, collect a special resource, use it to make an upgraded space suit, then make your way to a second waypoint, and voila, the game is finished.

The game is fully released now (with 3 new chapters full of gameplay and a lot of polishing). We’ve made changes to game balance - now the base level of oxygen is at 75 seconds, some tools have more durability, some items are easier to build, and much more. 

We want to make sure the balance is right now. We would be happy if you could try Breathedge again and let us know how it goes. Let us know your thoughts by sending us a message to info@breathedge.com or visit our discord channel: https://discord.com/invite/eyURQXG and let us know what you think!

I really enjoy the atmosphere and the narrator is fantastic. Certain parts are fairly dumbed down compared to what you would expect in a typical RTS, but I don't consider that a bad thing (in fact I would say it works great in this kind of game). Your minions are mostly automated and will do their jobs and train themselves but as the underlord you can of course micro them as much as you want. I also find the idea of you as the dungeon master having a mana bar as a resource to cast spells, build defences, and hire workers pretty unique as well. 

Now that's not to say the game doesn't have some problems. Even though your minions are autonomous they are sometimes kind of stupid and don't sleep, eat, or get their paycheck quick enough and you'll often get messages that they're unhappy. This can usually be solved by just clicking on them and dropping them into the area they are lacking in but I don't really think you should have to do that when you don't have them assigned to anything. 

The worker flag is kind of irritating too because you can either force all workers to work on an area (sometimes I want like  2-3 still working on the other side) or you can let them decide what to prioritize and sometimes they'll just dig walls or run off to another task instead of placing all the floor tiles down while I'm waiting to make a room. Note that this may just be me not being good enough at the game to figure out how to assign workers properly.

The economy system is kind of wierd too. You get unlimited gold from workers mining these ""gold shrines"" which are big rectangular boxes. I think if maybe gold acted like mana where you could mine a big chunk of it, but it wouldn't start recharging until you stopped mining it for awhile it might be better? I'm not sure. This isn't really a major complaint but it's something I dislike. 

Overall, the game does have a number of issues, but nearly all of them can be overlooked or are very minor. I do highly recommend trying out War for the Overworld because it does feel really unique to play as an actual bad guy for once.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2016. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the performance and stability of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development from our two-man code team. 

There is also now the second expansion, the Crucible survival mode, that was free for all! 

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

You play as that man, a scientist teaming up with two mercenaries to infiltrate a stronghold that is Cherno's own Nuclear Powerplant. As visions of a bi-gone time flash before your eyes you and your companions find a reservoir of an unknown substance of virtually unknown power. As you take an sample to leave this depressing foundation a man in a black gas mask teleports in. He guns one of your companions down, wounded the other and takes the picture of your wife. Vowing to hunt you down, you escape before he could lay his hands on you. Now in a place that almost looks like the Matrix you see a path ahead... slowly you start down the trail.

Heh, Every review I try my hardest to make a scene for you as the reader. The problem is I have no idea how to describe the visuals. It's like if the Matrix was taking place in Russian, was now a horror movie, and instead of Agent Smiths running about it's abominations brought by... well I rather not spoil it.
Let's lay out how I will review everything as I have played till the stopping point in the story, met all the characters, and generally have seen quite a bit of what the game has to offer in my 13ish hours of playing. Let's start off with the story, then move on to the characters, the weapons ""my favorite"", and then finally an overall opinion on whether or not the game is worth your time.

Story - Now the story involves time travel ""I think"" and some inter-dimentional bullshit to put it bluntly. I find it personally interesting and is a more Supernatural version of game series like Stalker and Metro as people commonly point to as an comparison. While more than likely inspired by both those games, this is nothing like the two. In terms of the Gameplay and Story. This is not a tale of survival in the traditional sense. Your character and NPC you house have to eat and that is one of the main priorites, managing supplies. However multiple times throughout the story your character is told he could simply leave and go back to civilization. No this game is a Love story, a tale of a hero trying to save a princess. It just so happens this princess is in through some Science mumbo jumbo inter-dimentional crap with visions of death and destruction thrown in for good measure. While trying to save your wife, you will also discover that this game is like those old detective games. You will piece together clues and facts to find out the why? Why did my wife disappear? Who is this Black Stalker hunting me? And many other questions that will need answering. 

Now the folks you will meet will help you on your quest. However each of them have their own reasons for joining you. After all the world is not a charity. That starts with supplies, food, etc. Or helping them with their problems. Ranging from helping a town in need to blowing up a Antenna Line to disrupt communications between the enemies. However each main story action has consequences that will affect how these NPCs will view you, and can even cause some to abandon you if you don't find that happy medium of friendship between everyone. However what I think could use some improvements is while I had a guy absolutely hate my guts, I generally found his decision making stupid and could get many people killed, every time I talked with him he still had his personality as if I just met him. No varying lines referencing what you've done in the story or how pissed/happy they are with you. Just general jargon. Unfortunate, but can be fixed and does not knock these characters in the slightest. 

Oh boy my favorite part, GUNS! Man the person you play as is a generally level headed individual who hates killing and violence because he is a damn hippy or something. Then when I played I slaughtered the entire level several times over on the hardest difficulty. I just found that thought line in my head funny, Anywho! This game has 4 main Weapons, one that I will not cover, but is basically the BFG from doom. First the Nagant Revolver. This is absolutely one of the most satisfying revolvers in gaming. 2 shots to a typical enemy and the ammo is plentifulish. The sound is just simply devine coming from a gun fellow and the reload is both realistic and strangely efficient for the main character who renounces violence. Now to go from a great revolver to a almost DOOM 3 shotgun. It either hits like a damn run away train that is on FIRE or shoots candy. Very weird, but still not a bad shotgun. Works very well against the Monsters of the levels, not so much the people. Finally the one I was looking forward to, the Automatic Kalashnikov 47. It's meh honestly. The full auto version I find, with maxed out perks, to be very weak at distance and not as good as the wonky shotgun at close range. The Sniper/Semi Auto version is pretty Ok, It has great range and is generally a good long range weapon. The problem is the ammo and that the Revolver is god's gift to you the player. 
(Warning Rant about Guns Incoming! Skip to ""Rant Over"" if you want to go back to the review) Now I am a bit of a gun guy, so the customization of the weapons was appealing to me! However some of the choices and wording of the upgrades made me just question them. Example the Nagant Revolver holds 7 rounds in the Cylinder and is reloaded using a rod that pushes the empty case out of the chamber like the Colt Single Action army of the Wild West. In this game there is a 9 Round Cylinder that gives just a bit more ammo for longer reloads as the downside. Which is fine in game play. The problem is that the 9 round Cylinder apparently uses ""Smaller Rounds"" so that it can take up the same space, but have more ammunition. Firstly, this is a bad idea due to headspace in a typical firearm. If your barrel and round don't have a snug fit, the resulting explosion from the round will BLOW up your damn gun! Secondly, even if the character changed the round and barrel to fit the new round there is another issue. The rounds from the 7 shot cylinder and 9 round cylinder do the same damage. While bullets vary in real life, the general case that I've seen in games is the smaller the round is in a game the less damage it will do. Take 9mm vs 44 Mag. 9mm has more ammo in the magazine, but much less damage than the powerhouse of a round the 44 Mag. Finally they could have fixed this shower thoughts in my head by simply just removing the ""smaller rounds"" part. Metro Exodus has a revolver that can change it's cylinder from a six shot to an eight shot cylinder of 44 Mag. While the pressures exerted on the cylinder may eventually blow up the gun, I find that far more believeable, that somebody found an new and interesting way in the wasteland to make a revolver hold eight rounds than completely milling out a new barrel and cylinder in a backyard shop. This happens a lot in the game, where I read what the attachment does in game and think to myself that's just wrong. Personally it's a bit of a gripe that shouldn't affect many other people besides me.
(RANT Over)
Finally, should you buy this game. That depends. Do you enjoy story games, ones of horror and adventure in a ravaged hell scape? Did you enjoy Stalker and or Metro and are looking for something to hold you over till the next installment of the games? I'd say go for it then! There are many underlining problems. I think the AI could use some work, I once fell out of the map and stared into the void of a level. Even with these problem I had a blast. Once these kinks are ironed out I can see this game being a pretty damn good one. So place that Gasmask on and let's head into the green haze of a Russia to find love once more.",1605061545,1605061545,True,2,0,0.0,0,True,False,True,False,,1605093508.0,"Hey!

I'm a fan of Mechanic games so I know what I should be doing.
The controls could be improved. It's like walking on Ice. The camera and Mouse controls are too fast for my taste and I turned of Motion blur after 3 minutes. Also I needed to disconnect my XBOX controller to be able to play with mouse which is a bit stupid.
So, far I managed to only play the first 10 jobs. The translation(?) seems to be a bit off. At least regarding the English. ""utilization""? 
Anyway, with a bit polish this might become an cool game. I'll definitely keep playing it. Hope this doesn't get abandoned.",1574995758,1574995758,True,2,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,,,989770

TL;DR is an entertaining game but has big flaws on gameplay and features:  movement is meh, bullets collision isn't consistent and the minions can walk/shoot through the geometry and there is no reward for killing/wining a match :/

Is entertaining game however falls very short on the gameplay and progression. Higher level weapons make less damage (wtf). 
Also the current state is unplayable because the mechanics aren't helpful. The spawn point is next to a base instead of the HQ - making harder to save your base :( ... and the bullets go where they want. The minion NPCs are way too overpower and 90% of the time spawn on top of me and kill with 1 hit (maybe is due the lag?).

There are only 2 game modes which limits the playability and there is no music (RIP) either in game or in the menu.

Finally, the AI is just broken.The enemy team has better weapons (more damage, accuracy and fire rate) also the AI NEVER runs out of bullets and can hit anyone from afar.

The thing I hate the most is that the few human players I encounter just camp ._. 

Nevertheless, this is a good indie game and the price is just right. I hope to see some improvements/features over time.",1562539762,1563044000,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,1562790531.0,"It's sad that you didn't like the game :(

Maybe I can help you to understand some design goals of this game.

1) No weapon or class or vehicle is better than the other, they should be ""different"". You can find slow and inaccurate, but powerful weapon, or fast and very accurate. They are all procedural, so yes of course there will be some luck involved. Find the one that suits your style and mood and stick with it for some time.

2) Teamwork is essential. You simply won't survive without your team. Want unlimited bullets? Get a team mate who plays a tank nearby. Hovers give health, copters give shields, tanks give bullets and artillery give spawn points (you should not be under attack for some time to receive resources)

3) Spawn point is on the base and on the artillery class team mates. The artillery class should be behind the lines (sort of), that's why they have only long range weapon classes. You should protect them, and wipe out enemy artillery if you want to stop the attack, because if you don't they will continue to respawn on artilleries (so should you too if you want to continue attacking that point).

And I can assure you that there are simply no cheats in AI, they play by the same rules as you.",605920

deducting from the time you played our game it looks like you played it from A to Z.

I'm sorry to hear that you didn't like it in the end.

We have launched an update recently that tries to fix many of the issues you're mentioning: 

We added many new events, a host of new battle arenas, three different battle modes, and 18 distinct combat abilities, amongst others.

We also reworked our skilltrees so that levelling up should now feel more rewarding. A new item system and new unique artefacts were added as well.

Should you take a look at our post-upgrade player feedback, you will notice that it has improved substantially.

So if you were thinking of giving Pathway another shot, this might be a good time for it!",546430

You may think completely different, and that is 100% okay!

So I was very much excited for this game. The music sounded cute, the art was absolutely stunning and the story seemed really awesome! Fairytales and a dating sim? Heck yeah I'm down for this! So I bought it the day it came out.

.. and refunded it about 2 hours later. I want to like it, I honestly do. But there is just so much about that either doesn't sit well for me or I just simply hate and with a price tag of over $30 I just can't justify buying a game I'm not in love with.

Some problems I had included very minor things like spelling mistakes, the default name being said which was rather jarring, the third person perspective was okay at first but I felt so disconnected from the Protagonist that I couldn't get as interested in the story as I'd liked, and around the 2 hour mark my game wouldn't stop lagging, which really surprised me.

But the most jarring thing? The actual romance. After refunding the game I looked up a quick summary/review to see what I was going to be missing out on and holy-! The amount of NTR in this game is awful, and some of it is impossible to avoid, which really didn't sit well with me. 

Again, this is my own opinion and don't let this stop you from purchasing it. Am I glad I refunded it? Yes. Completely. Would I purchase this again in the future? Honestly, yes.

I have no idea what is wrong with this game so I cannot recommend a game that I cannot play due to bad servers.managed to fix the issue by changing servers.apparently the default server either don't work or it's for another country. played for about 2 hours almost as a rogue. the classes seem to have 4 skills and an auto attack and leveling up gives buffs to your skills and such. kind of basic in terms of skills, tab target combat that allows players to move and avoid some telegraphed attacks. would be much better if they implemented a action combat system since it seems like it would be capable but as it is the combat is bland and boring the graphics are pretty bad but it is also a phone game so that is alright. has a lot of classes to unlock but I have no idea how to unlock them yet but you can only do 1 class quest a day so it is probably pay walled or time gated big time. crafting is time gated and can be bypassed by a ingame currency which is probably real money. the game lets you pick any item even the ones with stats to wear over your characters currently equipped items as cosmetic so you can be wearing full platemail and it can look like you are wearing a robe. would be cool if they gave an option to hide the helmet of your character..or they may have and I could not figure out how to do so. as far as I have played in 2 hours it is too boring to recommend since the classes don't get enough skills for my liking (this reminds me more of trove in terms of classes/skills than the usual mmo games like ever quest and wow which give so many skills and hotbars that you can no longer see the screen :P which I prefer since it gives the option to choose what you want to do unlike this where you just gonna hit like 3-4 buttons for each fight. will update if things change for me as I continue to play. : 8 hours in same as before not much changed, tried mage and warrior too and mage seems to be the best and easiest of the starters and takes no skill just spam the dmg skills than get mana back from frost skill. the warrior is brain dead as you would expect in a way as you have no resource requirements but when you max the resource after using a skill enough it boosts the damage of the next skill so any brain function in this class is simply using the damage bonus on what skill does the most damage from it and the rogue is the hardest of the three starters as you have the option to skillfully time skills and your auto attack to apply stacks of poison as fast as possible and then turning it into better poison than reapplying regular poison fast again and using your cool downs well timed for the best potential dps. I am working on unlocking the archer next than I will try to unlock paladin but every class is very time gated to 1 class quest a day for a bigger boost to your class tokens which are used to unlock classes and very limited quest that give a small amount of tokens. it is unfortunate but this game that people say has no pay to win in it actually does with one of the classes being locked for a big price....I hate it when devs lock stuff behind real money like that and considering almost everything in this game is super time gated it will probably take a long while to unlock all the classes that can be unlocked for free. would be cool if they implemented a skill augmentation for more customization for instead allowing someone to pick a sub class that would give bonuses to the skills of the main class as added effects for instance maybe making the mage a subclass for something like the archer could maybe make some of his skills do an aoe explosion for extra damage and another skill maybe shoot an ice arrow to freeze an enemy so the class has more than one root for the passive making it a bit better and more useful. doubtful though that the devs will see my post or implement any of these ideas.

The art is ... um. Low-budget indie. It is of course basically Terraria / Minecraft under the hood. And on a keyboard + mouse, it can be a little tricky since side-scroller platformers for me are just kind of anchored to a hand-held controller.

And then I kept playing. And every time I went into one of the pre-built maps to explore or do a quest or something, I kept encountering some interesting little platformer obstacle course to navigate or discovered a secret hidden chest or was surprised by an uber mob I'd never seen before. And although the English localization is absolutely swamped with spelling errors and awkward phrasing, I found the dialogues and plot to be, well, charmingly sincere and executed with the distinct style of a well-worn song that is performed perfectly, without wonky gimmicks or kitschy in-jokes. Movement and combat are precise and responsive which is pretty important for this type of game. Base building and supply management is satisfying without being horribly grindy (though, let's be real, a *leeeettle bit* of grind is why we play this genre anyway). And although the sprites are... primitive... the variety of fashion options for personal customization is larger than I expected.

My main complaint is that the variety of active skills available is extremely small. You'll be using the same spell or type of weapon for basically 90% of the game from the tutorial on. And almost all of the talents just give you minor passive scaling to keep up with the hit points of enemy creatures as you go. Which is painfully boring and a waste of the game's potential as a platform adventurer. There are also some pretty glaring balance problems which can saddle you with a burning resentment after you realize that you can't respec your character for a long time yet but getting more points is going to take forever and all the points you've spent so far don't really matter because your summoned rats and wolves do pathetic damage and die instantly, even after wasting all your gear to pump them. Meanwhile even the weak ice bolt is doing twenty times the damage with one shot and you haven't even got any gear equipped for it and hardly any points spent in that tree. And your ice bolt goes where you tell it to instead of sitting around next to enemies, unresponsive.

The developer is (slowly) continuing to work on it. It's got all the potential of Terraria but has a far more narrative / RPG architecture with some absolutely fantastic level design. Hopefully they address the combat powers / talents to make them more interesting and varied soon.

I have to admit it's worth the pricetag even if they don't, though.",1677701347,1677701457,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,True,,,,490280

Updated review:
So they have made a lot of improvements to the menu system and overall music selection. It's definitely better than before. I initially bought this game (and returned it) for it's advertisement of electric swing titles that all seemed to require a DLC to obtain. Since they sent me a free key, it seems like most of them are now included in the game.  Cool beans. Game play seems to be slightly improved since my last review but still generally the same. Kudos to the vendor for listening to customer feedback and acting on it.

 This port of W101 is just simply ""You can now play the game on Steam now have fun"". Number one problem about this game is that you cannot link your W101 account. This is absolutely unacceptable. Keep in mind this is a game where you have to pay to open areas where you can progress the story, and not being able to use your account where you spent real money is just bad. Keep in mind that this game is 10 years old, imagine the veterans like me that want to experience the adventure again with the same account you have been playing for almost 10 years now and thrown dozens of dollars into. How much of a dissappointment this is.
     2nd problem being is that you still have to use the W101 website to pay the microtranscations. This is the Steam Version, this should not be here at all. Keep in mind that even Ubisoft of all companies lets you purchase DLC through Steam, even when it uses 3rd party programs. Just set up a heccing digital currency pack in the DLC section. It is not that hard.
     3rd problem is that there is only a free version. I would happily pay a 20-35 dollar fee to have access to all areas permanently so I would not have to give in to the mandatory microtransactions at all. A 1 Year membership (Access to all areas, digital currency pack, etc.) is like $50USD for 1 year, THIS GAME IS 10 YEARS OLD. Just have a purchasable version for around 30 dollars, but still allow the purchase of digital currency for optional mounts, pets, etc.

I want to like this game, it has a great concept and the devs have done a lot but ultimately I cannot find a fun experience.

For the dev:
I've already addressed this in my survey that is opened when you uninstall but buildings are near useless, Tier 2 fence taking 3 swings from infected before falling to 2 blips of health. 5 Infected almost overwhelmed 2 MG turrets. Took the engineer a whole day to patch ONE fence piece and most of the corner piece. 

Changed the day juggernauts spawn, they still spawn on day 2. Infected soldier shows up and one shots my engineer and soldier, and proceeds to soak up bullets from 2 said MG turrets for an entire minute, only falling to almost 3/4ths health and then Juggernaut shows up and destroys the turrets and barricade.

Game balance is so skewed towards the infected it's crazy. I've completed Pandemic mode in the past (well I cleared everything and chased around an invicible Chelsea) and the balance was good then, but my buildings and soldiers are shooting nonlethal and the fences are made out of twigs and twine.

The pangu virus has become the kevlar virus.

This is on experimental. I had to play experimental though as non-experimental seen absolute zero infected spawning. Well, sort of, the police faction obliterated them the second they spawned. I had to use a lot of drones to find that out.

I look forward to you fixing your game, but after 2 years+ I'm going to have to give you the thumbs down. This game is so far up my alley, a lot of issues I had were addressed in the past like bad pathfinding for people and vehicles, new things have been added but it's just not enough for me to be interested and frankly I'm annoyed that it was in a more playable state in the past compared to now.",1677454226,1677472938,False,1,1,0.4702970385551452,0,True,False,True,True,,1677467183.0,Please explain why you dislike the current game  balance so we can address it,979640

STEAM offered me 25% discount and i ended up somehow buying this game with 20% off (((((). Yes, it wasn't expencive. But still i do not think it is worth it's price.
I enjoyed playing beholder. Played it till the end only once. During the second time i was bored...
So after the ""special"" sale and commercial that it is from the creators of the Beholder or related to that game sort of... i bought it.
I liked the idea, the introduction. But my eyes got tired very quickly. Although it may be because i set the brightness as the game recommended and played late at night. Not sure. But i can play much more comlicated games and this is the first game in 5 years that got my eyes hurt allmost instantly. Oh no, there was Evil Within with the same effect on my eyes.
No problems with the gameplay. Each ""hero"" has to deal with 3 problem: hunger, tiredness, cold, - check health and find ""the way out"" to the next level. For the game of this level it is enough.
My biggest issue was that you can't restart the game if your players die. The game saves your progress. You return, where you left the game. But if you die, you need to start from the beginning. 

WARNING, there may be SPOILERS: in my exact case one of the players bled out to death. I used 2 med kits (whitch do not stop bleeding dkw, although the are of 3 components and can be made only in 1 room at the map) and 2 shots of adrenalin and still he died of bleeding. It was just bad luck i couldn't find clean bandages 2 levels. Unlucky object respawn and i need to play all over again. Too complicated for Alawar game and for ""easy"" mode. It is supposed to be fun, entertaining and relaxing. If i am not tired and have free time i'd rather play L4D2 or anything else next time.

Left with the strange feeling: this is a game for girls. I played on ""easy"" level and couldn't walk through 3 levels. Wanted to play more but then get riminded that i need to start from the very beginning. It is the 21 century. People invented savings and checkpoints.

AdventureQuest Worlds (aq.com/play-now), or even AdventureQuest (battleon.com) provide a far better gameplay experience than this.

The headway we make on AQ3D, which is our first cross platform game, will help us work on improving our older 2D games and make them cross platform as well! Regarding the graphics and movement, we do suggest going to the in game options at the top left of the login screen and tweaking your graphics quality, camera options and resolution as this has helped other players who reported issues with the graphics and movement in game.

The survival mode is pretty well fleshed out, and some of the stuff missing was added in the economy update some time ago. What seems like a pretty substantial amount of time in-game is still a drop in the bucket. Making new vehicles that aren't just flying bricks is still the most difficult part. I've spent days to weeks working on new designs, only to step back and realize that this new style is still blockish in one dimension or another. It's fun.

I started out in survival, and that was interesting. Having to farm for ore with meager supplies, slowly building a small fort to create more advanced parts. Then having to branch out and search for cobalt, gold, and other things. If you want to get started in this game, you'll need to spend several hours watching videos on YouTube that further explain some of the mechanics of the game, but you could just hop in and learn as you go.

Klang, the God of this game's physics, is known destroyer of complicated machinery, typically involving Merge blocks, rotors, and pistons. Expect to meet this god as you learn your way through the game. Some of the physics of the blocks are weird, not allowing you build in certain ways. Also, forget about building round things without spending hours working around the limitations of the blocks. Otherwise, build what you want.

Tons of good stuff on the workshop to download. Ship, planet, base blueprints and then the tons of mods that add thrusters, doors, scripts to manage turrets, and tons of other stuff. I recommend the Smart Solar Panel mod, that adds rotors that track the sun and follows it accordingly.",1574181597,1574181597,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,,,,244850

There's also quite a fun trade system, and the PVE system can be fun as well; however, I haven't played around with that as much.

There is a PVP system as well, but I can't speak to that as I've yet to play in the Open World.

I really enjoy that you can play in a Solo mode, and still be connected to the servers with the galaxy changing around you based on what other players are doing, and can still participate in online events and change the galaxy yourself. Essentially you just can't see other players. You can also play with a private group, all the same stuff, but can only see the people in your group.

I spent some time looking for a fix... but all I found were people having the same issue and replies from others stating ""I'm having the same problem. Help!"" and others from devs telling us ""to send them a ticket"".
From all the similar posts I saw online, I'm guessing the ""tickets"" didn't help at all...

- We now credit ALL players 1100 spectra when they join, so you can buy any character you want right off the bat. We also gave this to all existing players, so if you haven't spent yours yet, it's ready for you now.

- You can now try out ANY character in training mode. This was a key request from players who wanted to try out characters before picking one up.

In addition to the above, we're working on several new features to make the game fun and engaging right from the get go. This includes granting a character much earlier and giving more ways to earn spectra. We expect those to start coming online soon.

This is just the start. We entered Early Access so that we can work directly with you to make Icons ready for the world. You can read about the roadmap here:

The graphics look old indeed but that's for you to judge if it's a bad thing, I personally like it. Old games are one of the best in the RTS genre. :)
The game doesn't necessarily bring so many new things to the RTS genre, it's however different but still alike with other Real Time Strategy games regarding the resource gathering, units battle, units production population  etc...
The multiplayer sadly is not as I expected, you need to request the IP of your friend in order to play and if you don't have a friend, multiplayer is not an option for you.

I recommend this game if you look forward for diversity in the RTS genre but if you are looking for a game that offers a good story that makes your tears drop (like SC2 did for me), a good competitive level gameplay and intense multiplayer, you should go search for other games.

I'm not sure if it's appropriate to share my thoughts but I'm sincerely grateful for their feedback and yours as well. I do hope that they could at least take another look. The game is evolved over the last few months - I won't say it's a totally different game but it's definitely more streamlined thanks to community feedback.

Please feel free to copy and paste the response below onto your youtube video. Thanks!!!

Dear all,

I'm the developer for Foresight RTS. I've seen your comments. Regardless of whether if you like Foresight or not, I thank you all for taking a look. Yes, there had been issues with the game due to our lack of experience in the field. But we're catching up, listening to feedback, improving the game and adjusting the price to the best we could. More improvements, bug fixes and contents will be coming in the near future.

Despite being marked as release, Foresight is still developed like an early access title. We're still listening to your feedback and will implement the necessary changes to improve the game further. We will do whatever we can to make it better for you guys to play.

Our main game website is here www.foresightrts.com - here the information on all the faction can be found.

Please allow me to summary what Foresight really is:
1) Automation - Enough of all those typical RTS chores. Let Foresight do it for you intelligently and reasonably. Leave build orders and production management behind; Foresight will automatically choose the lightest load for ship queues (unless you specify otherwise)
2) Fleets - Nope these aren't unit groups. Fleets are created with officers who will help craft the fleet's composition of ships and requests to move, attack, defend and so on. They talk to you. You make the decision and ultimately, the responsibility.
3) Strategic Relevance - I'm not saying that NO RTS games do that. But we've designed Foresight to reward players who think strategically. Think of flank attacks, rear attacks, ambushes, blitzkreig, defensive battles, counter-attacks ... You're rewarded by design when you execute these battle plans successfully.

No, there isn't any silver bullet units that will crush your opponents. Building the largest ships simply won't do. You need to have the right combination to counter various potential threats. Fighters are nimble, but bombers will really do the damage if you're not careful.

Have a closer look, I'd say. If it's still bad, we're all ears to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement. :)

Regards,
Foresight Team

Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. 

Sadly due to the complexity of the game, adding more game speeds is not a viable option due to limitations of PC equipment. However, after listening to player feedback we have released the 1.9.0.35 patch on November 9 that addresses a number of balancing issues slowing down the start of a game.

These changes should improve the speed of the game and result in less waiting around for the player. Furthermore we have released another patch to address, amongst other things, builder's efficiency which should help to improve the speed which buildings are built.

We will continue to monitor feedback and tweak and improve as we continue to develop the game. With these tweaks and improvements, hopefully we can earn a positive review in the future.

It's cool to play, even if I fail. However, it's not cool if your crew is a bunch of braindead electric ants. Let me explain.

I had a night when there was absolutely no wind, and I didn't have enough electricity to make it through the night. How could I have? The game tells to build wind power. Why should I build it if I can't last the night even with it? Well, thanks to the power outage, people didn't sleep or eat or anything. What kind of a human being requires electricity to sleep anyway? If that wasn't enough, I already had a shortage of food and other materials. I could've really used people who did their fricking tasks. But instead they wanted to sleep. All at once. Because of that, nothing got built. Absolutely everything collapsed because of this.

Don't get me wrong, I like a game with challenge, but this is bullsh*t. The difficulty comes mostly from RNG and bad AI. That's kinda weak. The crew needs like 10 minutes to make a single piece of metal. From mining the ore to hauling it to base to somebody bothering to process it. I kinda liked the game until I hit the wall of nothing getting done because everything went in a snail's pace. I had to tend to every need of the crew while waiting for more metal to be processed, but that just meant I had to build more stuff and get more crew. Unfortunately, this meant I had to build even more because they couldn't survive with what I had already built.

Is every game of this a snowball rolling down to the depths of hell? Is this what this game is about? I get it, it's hard to make resources but it's a fricking meat grinder.

If possible, I'd like there to be a patch of some kind to make it easier to mine metal. Because frankly, it sucks right now. I hate it because it could be a really great game, especially with some kind of objectives instead of a sandbox.

The Last Dogma is a first person exploration / action game from one-man-band indie developer, Sasha Darko.

In the Last Dogma you play Sebastian, a tough-guy ATF agent working in Serbia (or is it Russia? I'm not quite sure). The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, though, so I'm happy to be told that I misunderstood.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The Last Dogma's graphics fall over a large range. From a creative, but minimalist, 'meta room' in the tutorial, complete with labelled objects and development texture maps, to the in-game forest of the first level, and the great, super-bright glowing of the second (or third?) level, I was really quite impressed with some of them. Smoke and other special effects are very good, too. Character models fall fairly solidly in the middle ground. And then some of the level geometry and textures are eye-bleedingly bad: I gave myself a headache from squinting at some of the glaring reddish textures inside some of the buildings; noticed quite a few examples of terrain not fitting together, leaving holes in the level geometry; and just found myself confused with some of the later levels.

Options are equally confusing, with three resolutions available: HD, HD-Ready, and FULL HD. Similarly, detail levels make no sense: True, Medium, and Pentium 486.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
Sound effects are pretty good. Volumes seem to be properly normalised and nothing stands out as being out of place.

The game includes voices for the main characters, and these range in quality. The narrator voice sounds professional and is the best of the lot, while some of the others, including Sebastian, aren't that great. But all are much better than I had expected after reading some other reviews.

The title theme is an ambient sort-of slightly chilling score, which I found fit the game quite well. There are sections of the game with similarly minimalistic tunes and background noises that are also well done.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The Last Dogma is a first-person action/adventure game with some light combat. It's set in a weird alternate-history Eastern Europe, full of cults, cannibals, and weird demon-god-thingies. Sounds confusing? Yeah, it is.

The tutorial introduces you to the basics in a somewhat humorous way, with a dead-pan narrator and a single room set up like a development test. It's a nice start. The game then throws you straight into its weirdness, though, with a comic-style introduction and a nice forest scene. WASD and mouse control movement and combat, as you'd expect, and the handful of remaining keys are easy to remember.

Each level is moderate in size, but there's not that much to do. You walk around, talk to the few NPCs, sometimes biff a few baddies, and try to find the exit to the next level. There's no map, but the levels are fairly empty, so you shouldn't be stuck looking for the exit for too long. There aren't any puzzles, or that much to see. I guess some might stick it in the genre of 'walking simulator', and wouldn't be far wrong.

The story is a bit ridiculous and hard to understand. It's confusing enough, in fact, that the developer posted story spoilers on the game's web site, although that seemed to be down at the time that I tried to connect, leaving me still in the dark. It's creative in some ways, but feels quite immature, jumping all over the place in a way that feels very forced. To top it off, the writing itself is of fairly poor quality, and could definitely use another proofreading pass, or seven.

You can't skip the tutorial, and when only Chapter 1 has been unlocked the chapter select option doesn't work, forcing you to start again (and sit through the tutorial again, too). I also found the game crashed when minimising and restoring on a couple of occasions, so I've now seen the tutorial four times.

The game really suffers from lack of polish and attention to detail, too. From the tutorial that incorrectly names the game (""The Last Disbeliever"") in the opening lines, to the subtitles that don't match the spoken words, the poor grammar, and the terrain meshes that have holes in them and cause you to get stuck, The Last Dogma feels like it should still be in beta.

[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]
Pros:
+ Graphics are well done on some levels
+ Music and sound are pretty good
+ Voiceovers
+ Steam Achievements and Trading Cards

Cons:
- Nonsensical story that may offend and is not written well
- Lack of general polish
- Achievements don't seem to work (I completed the game with the 'perfect' ending and didn't get the ""You've completed the main campaign."" achievement)

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
The Last Dogma is a bit of a confusing mess. Given the lack of that much to actually do, the bugs, the nonsensical story, and the general lack of polish, it's hard to recommend. But it's a shame; it's definitely creative, and some of the graphics and sound are really rather good.

I'm really on the the fence with this one. I think it's a thumbs down, but only just. Still, if it seems like your sort of thing, and you don't mind your games a bit 'raw', by all means pick it up when it's next on sale.

There are some details to clarify and (indeed) misunderstood things to explain. And something to confirm, too.


[b]About story[/b]
The game can look pure nonsense on the surface until you start looking deeper. It's not like everything will be clear, it's just won't look entirely absurd. I'm not trying to say there's something “super smart” underneath, I just wanted to write a completely unique story in a most unconventional way, no tired tropes and cliches, so the sacrifices were made and many traditional elements were thrown out. 
Some things are never explained for the sake of realistic storytelling (yes, in a surreal game), some things are cryptic just for the sake/fun of it and some references are so obscure that perhaps only 5-10 players in the world will understand them. For example, referencing some obscure Japanese adventure game (which was only released in EU/Japan on Sega Saturn or maybe even didn't have such luxury to be translated) is a pretty usual thing for me in that matter. Playing Sacred Line (a freeware game on which The Last Dogma is based on, available here as a free DLC) will also help to understand some minor details.

In many ways the game is similar to movie Southland Tales, I even put the name of the movie right above the logo. Both are chaotic in nature and absurd on the surface and both got very negative reviews because of that. I ended up writing a developer commentary with some explanations about the story as an extra bonus, but some people on Steam just take as an insult and developer's inability to provide a coherent storytelling.Which was never the intention.
Speaking of that commentary, you wrote the review about the same time the game website which had it was shutdown after four years of existing. I've already re-uploaded the commentary: http://sashadarko.com/the-last-dogma-developer-commentary/

[b]Missing textures and bad level geometry[/b]

You probably mean The Red Desert level. There's an “red light” effect which I added to make it the location more surreal and haunting. I tested the level many times and honestly have no problem with it whatsoever, this is also the first time I read it's “eye bleeding” to somebody.
There are indeed some problems with terrain geometry on Desert level and most of them tied to default Unity terrain engine, which is known among developers for being extremely poor and only allowing to create terrains which look like the 90s/early 2000s 3D games. There's an advanced solution (i.e. plugin) to create better terrains but it cost something around 150-200$ and I couldn't afford it.

HD = 720p, HD-Ready = 768p, Full HD = 1080p. Not sure how it's confusing, although...it's probably an European thing and Americans don't see these labels on US monitor/TV boxes.
True = The way the game is supposed to look, Medium = Medium (literally), Pentium 486 = A somewhat standard joke which means “Old hardware” and in the game context it means “Low settings”. I could name it “Potato” like some other developers do these days, but I have a somewhat nostalgia for old computers so it's named that way. 


[b]About Achievements[/b]
There is no Steam Achievements feature listed in the Steam features and there never were any Steam achievements (which is important). There are two in-game achievements, both of which are jokes which make fun of the Achievements system itself and will never “unlock”.
These two Steam achievements you mean were recently made public on Steam for the matter of testing (no other way to do this). But then I found out that the Unity version I used to make the game (4.2) won't allow me to implement Steamworks without updating the engine to 4.6.1. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]

Yes, there are no puzzles. I'm not a fan of  puzzles which have nothing to do with common logic (like King's Quest puzzles), something like HOG mini-games wouldn't make any sense being in the game and they would be a stupid and unnecessary cliché. I wouldn't mind to add some physics-based puzzles, but there are so many games with physics puzzles out there so it's practically impossible to create something new on that front. 

The game had two proofreaders, but only before the game was released. There were many changes in the story and dialogues after release, some parts were rewritten entirely. I suspect these new additions are the ones you mean. If you'll tell me where to look, I'll start looking. I'm obviously not a Native speaker and my native language is entirely different, but my English had improved significantly over years. 

There's might be some problem with Chapter Select, indeed. It seems it occurred after the last update, I'll look into it.
“The Last Disbeliever” is not a mistake, it was the game title right from the start and voice actor was given the lines which mentioned it. The name of the website and early promo videos also reflect that. It was some time before release when “Disbeliever” was changed to “Dogma”. The reason is simple, it's just sounds better and also helped to make the logo look better.",374510

Here's why I think that: The concept is nice, cars boats and planes racing all over America. It sounds good on paper but as the game really plays, the map is quantity over quality, in exchange for such a large map they had the game essentially looking like a mobile game. Another issue is the races are just boring roadtrips if they aren't just within a single city. That's all fine and dandy except when you consider the handling is very barebones and the sense of speed is basically nonexistent, plus the soundtrack isn't really the best so you're really just in for an incredibly boring, incredibly long ride. I have never fallen asleep playing games unless I was really comfortable but this game had me snoring while standing up, that's not what you want out of a video game. Another thing this game offers is vehicles. Personally I only really care about the cars and let me tell you, the car list is pretty solid. A good amount of tuner, muscle, and supercars. They even have a good selection of bikes and even a hovercraft if that tickles your fancy. The game also has customization which is where the fun ends for me. I do want to say that the customization isn't so bad, and it almost isn't. But it's mainly just splitter kits and tacky spoilers, alot of the better customized cars coming with some pretty ugly body kits that make Need for Speed Underground 2 look more considerable. If I had to say, I'd recommend just buying Forza Horizon, you'll have more fun with that mess than you will here. But if you want a real recommendation, despite the fandom calling it essentially one of the worst games ever, Need for Speed Unbound is a great game. Significantly better customization, more unique handling between cars, a banger soundtrack, colorful artstyle, beautiful city to go along with the stunning graphics, and the single player story is more interesting than whatever The Crew 2 has to offer. This game feels like a cheap yet incredibly overpriced Forza clone and it's not worth your time or money. I already wasted mine and have taken too long to get my refund, I just hope you can spare your wallet or save the money for something better. Maybe Motorfest will be better at least, I really do hope for the best for that game.",1678163901,1678163901,False,3,0,0.5634920597076416,0,True,False,False,True,,,,646910

The atmosphere is pretty good. The sound design is alright. Some of the level design is pretty good. But...the enemy and it's AI are extremely frustrating. It was so frustrating that I started the game intending to do at least 2 episodes on my channel but ended up only doing 1 because I just couldn't get through enough of the game to warrant a 2nd episode. The enemy will randomly appear out of nowhere and start stabbing you. If you aren't near a hiding spot or just happen to be close to it when it spawns, you're basically done. On top of that, there doesn't appear to be a way to heal yourself so you just run around with an increasingly ""Red"" screen making it very, very difficult to see. You appear to be able to sort of ""cheese"" the AI by running into some of the rooms but it doesn't always work properly and I had a difficult time getting some of the doors to close. I'm not sure what was up with the hitboxes but it seemed like I'd be looking right at the door and it just wasn't registering my inputs. 

I'd say if you like these kinds of cheaply made atmospheric horror games then you'll probably like this one. For me personally, I enjoyed some of it but not enough of it to warrant a recommend from me. Your mileage may vary since this one is kind of a toss-up. If we had a middle option I think that's probably where I'd settle on this game but since it's either recommend or not recommend, I have to say I don't recommend it. But it is free so it doesn't hurt anything to give it a try if you want to see what it's like.

First, for a MMO, the game's community is exceedingly welcoming to newcomers.  Many of the established players are willing to answer basic questions in the chat, and even provide early game resource donations.  The game world is suitably large and there is a strategic depth to the game that requires classic ""guns vs. butter"" decision making.

Those things said, there are two components of the game that prevent a recommendation.

There is absolutely a P2W aspect to the game.  It's not overbearing, but it is there.  There are time gates to facets of the game; things such as building construction, resource gathering, trade and others all occur in real time.  If you want to avoid the wait, you can ""rush"" the completion of these tasks by spending Prestige (the in game currency that is available for purchase).  

Of course, one can play the game in such a way that rushing construction and so forth doesn't make too big of a difference.  If you are of the mind that you simply wanrt to develop a network of varied cities, conduct research, gather resources and so forth without engaging in the PvP, you can certainly do so (so long as one of your more established neighbors doesn't get itchy and decide you are a prime target).  However, that brings up the second critical flaw.

As you constuct your initial city, you will be able to research certain technologies that allow for varied buildings and units.  This is all worthwhile as it forms the foundations of what your city can produce.  However, once you have progressed enough to settle a second city (and start thinking about the new tenor this city will possess) you are met with the fact that you have to start all research over again.  In other words, even though you researched the Militia technology in the first city (a necessity), you have to research it again in your new city.  Seeing as the object of the game is to create and foster an integrated kingdom, this mechanic makes absolutely no sense and is unnecessarily frustrating.

In the end, if you are looking to engage in the social aspect of a MMO, Illyriad is probably as good a choice as any other.  However, if you are looking for a game that provides a sense of progression and proportionate reward for effort, this game will likely disappoint.",1499432014,1499432551,False,50,4,0.800922155380249,7,True,False,False,False,,1582143665.0,"Thanks for the detailed feedback, we really appreciate well thought out critiques.

i can say as a single player experience its kind of... meh? you get infinite pauses, so you can micromanage your 2 (or 3 survivors, depending on how long you've played or if your lucky enough to find one passed out somewhere.) survivors to go to every building systematically, sharing their inventory through magical bag of holding, so one person looting a can of beans can teleport it to the other who can cook it up at the stove theyre sitting in front of...

i got to the end in single player, 'challenge mode', no problem... and then i was confused, the game tells me that in order to get a 'good end' i have to do something, and its not going to tell me what that is. oh well. (i'm being intentionally vague here, obviously.) i end up getting the 'second bad ending' because i didnt have the option to choose anything else... not having the required supplies despite having emptied out every single building for all of its resources along the way to the end, all 3 of my characters maxed out on their 'needs' with no particular health problems... they all died in an explosion because i didnt find the macguffin.

moving on to multiplayer....

i'm sure the devs know of this by now but there is an absolutely gamebreaking bug that occurs during online play in which randomly, while playing, the game will pop up a screen saying 'there is a problem with the internet connection, reloading the last save'. thats all well and good... but when your last autosave loads up you check your inventory to find that half of it has magically dissapeared... and more often than not includes valuble items like medkits and gas cans.... and i've seen it said many times over many reviews, this can break a run from 'we might just make it' to 'oh god lets just restart'... in my most promising run this ended with me and a freind on the 5th sector, i was passed out from a cold in a building we had designated as the 'eat sleep and warm up' building... all my freind had to do was find some wood to get me up, i had an adrenaline shot for him for when he went down, but you cant pass items to people when your down and they cant pick things off your body... i sat there as he looted buildings but he couldnt find any coal or wood... i HAD coal on me at one point in time, but a save deleted that... i HAD 3 medkits but they dissapeared as well, otherwise we both would have been in good health in a heated building, and then ran to the end to get the same ending i experienced in singleplayer... as neither of us had any equipment left regardless.

.... its frustrating, and of course i'm just telling my own personal experience with the game, it might have worked perfectly fine for someone doing a LAN in the same building, or perhaps online with a stronger internet connection...

and a last bit of gripe i suppose is scavenging... in singleplayer there are little events that sometimes happen when your looking around... aparently that was removed for co-op? i dont understand why.... as  it can give you an interesting boost or hinderance depending on your luck.... like poking the alien artifacts, either good or bad can come of it, and if your doing poorly, you might just consider that chance... things couldnt be worse... could they? there were also a few buildings that... for some reason were simply empty.... this is assumedly a base that was well used and full of people while they were researching what went on prior to the games events, there is very little reason for an entire building, locked doors and blockades and all... to have nothing but 2 boards sitting around in it.


alien monsters need more aggressive tactics as well as variety... as they are you can more or less literally run past/ignore them entirely, and they die slowly over time regardless so by the time they might be a threat to you they've already dissapeared.

i like this game and i want to see it do better, will probably check back in a few months to see if the bugs have been worked out, might even change my review then! my freind bought the game... he'll either buy it for me too or pressure me into buying it later to re-play it with him.",1523778563,1526402692,False,51,1,0.727130115032196,8,False,True,False,False,,1523876595.0,"1.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2017. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. One of these is completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate
- Entirely new Skirmish AI

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Cian

Since I laid my evil pawns on dungeon keeper during the starting age of gaming I have always missed a game like this! Some pitiful ""wannabes"" can be seen during the way from that time to now. None has even come close to awaken the child within me who always has been crying for the real feeling of a dungeon keeper game.
These guys have been working hard and in my opinion they have done everything they set out as goals during the kickstarter campaign. 

So to get some real numbers for you guys who like it, here it comes !

+ Good and worthy successor of the dungeon keeper game
+ Good atmosphere
+ RTS-game without to much micro on resources
+ You can ""kinda"" pick your own pace in the game
+ You can feel the evilness growing !
+ NO KITTY CATS

- Don't really feels polished at the tutorial levels
- The lore behind the campaign falls a bit short
- Optimization is a bit behind for the release of the game

Players face bots filling slots on both sides in the beginning - bots act as training wheels of sorts to allow the players to hone their skills and define their favored fighting range and tactics, after the first few levels bots are replaced by real players.

Hi Eagle Heart,

Thanks for writing this review.

We highly recommend playing the Learning to Survive scenario in order to gain a better understanding of how to play Space Engineers.

Additionally, this is a great video for newcomers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__G10lQXmXQ&t=15s

The setting is set on a stage and it's really surprising the first time when you see the buildings and environment being built right in front of your very own eyes. You as the player have some control over the three main characters of the play. I say some because I felt as though some of the selections that were given felt forced on me. 

Anyways, there are choices you can make (in a form of news reports that you can send to your editor/boss), that will determine how other non-playable actors will react to you.  Now, since there’s only one act, I am not sure how much of an impact my decisions will have on future acts so that is to be determined. I will update as more acts are added.

The characters are quirky, albeit strange at times but they all have unique personalities that set them apart from each other. I mean it’s not every day someone asks you to feed a raw chicken wearing a diaper to an alligator. (However, if this is an everyday occurrence to you, please call me.) Some of the dialogues are funny and the story is engaging. I believe it took me about 3.5 hours to complete the first act so it’s not too long. 

I would recommend this game, especially since the price dropped to $9.99. The developers are pretty responsive to their players. 

I’m not much for scoring but I suppose I would rate the first act a 7/10.

For your viewing pleasure, I uploaded my playthrough of this game on YouTube.

Could you go into a little more detail? After the last update and the crafting rework, the reception to crafting was stellar and people love it! 
I have to say, since the last update we've heard very few people say that enemies offer no challenge. Have you gone to a village/city and triggered the horde? 
Have you gone to an abandoned bunker and try to outwit Razors and Mr. Brenner? 
Higher the risk, higher the reward :) 
We'll be entering the polishing phase of the development process fairly soon, that's when we'll revisit every feature and tweak it/balance it out as much we can!
In any case, we hope you revisit the game and perhaps change your mind.

Thanks for the review and feedback! 

Since you posted this review we have released many bug fixes and recently added the Wine Production chain. This is part of the Monastery monument which is now in the game and much further developed.

Hide (Leather) is still not fully complete but you can now sell it to the trader. Glass also will be implemented in future updates but can be bought via trade until that time.

Your comments about trading are interesting and during development we will be looking at improvements and listening to community feedback.

There is a help menu (?) in game that explains a few of the game mechanics but we also understand the need for a tutorial which we will look at as we further develop the game.

Thank you again for the feedback and we hope we will be able to earn a positive review in the future.

You can barely interact with anything. There is not enough content. Haven't noticed any update. The game is way too simple. Once you complete the initial tutorial the game has nothing more to offer.

How do I spend most of the game time?
- The speed of the game is almost always at maximum, yet still have the bored feeling of having to wait for way too long (half an hour?!) for anything to happen.
- Turning on or off structures to reduce electricity usage.
- I can even ignore emergencies as I can't really interact with them and a redundantly built base just survives anything.
- Counting the pixels between dorm room bunk beds when placing them in order to be able to achieve 100% bunk bed count per dorm room - pretty annoying and boring.
- Interface for colonist hiring should have a disable colonist type option as I have been setting one type to 100% so many times to avoid random spawning, it would be easier to block the ones that I don't need actually.
- Sometimes I want to see the base, but can't. The camera is way too restricted. You can only have a hint of the nice sky above your planet as the game doesn't let you to change the view angle at all.

How are the challenge missions?
They turned off most of the game features and made you wait even more. The challenge is about patiently waiting to stockpile the resource needed to win. Very boring.

How is building?
Way too restrictive. You can't have separate bases on the same map, it has to be a single supercomplex. Half of the buildings can have only one entrance - otherwise will loose its purpose - making layout planning too annoying. Also buildings have to have a giant gap - distance between buildings is very restricted, taking any creativity out of the layout planning. The variety of buildings are way too low, some of them are even redundantly useless as the 2 types of recreational rooms can be substituted by the tv in a diner.

So if you don't have enough biologists or a meteor hits them and don't act fast by hiring biologists before the stockpiled food runs out, your entire colony dies out slowly, you wont be able to hire new colony members (biologists) once the starvation hits in as low morale prevents colonist ships from landing - in the meanwhile the few remaining biologists will work on producing food for others until they stupidly starve to death. Trading for food might save you if it's not a megabase over 100 colonists, but ironically trading ships always randomly don't bring the stuff you might need - there is no option to call for help or anything.

Trading?
The way trading works is just highly unprobable. In a real world scenario a trader wouldn't land on your planet unless he is absolutely sure that you will trade with him. They just land with a bunch of useless material so many times and its about WAITING for the right trader to come. Or spending your resources on another landing pad, so you can WAIT LESS.

The game is terribly overpriced. I would only recommend it to anyone under 1$.
You can get AAA games with 100000x more content for less.

Room for improvement?
Certainly yes, the core idea is great. Is there any developer reading these?
- different weapon types (machinegun, flamethrower) that can only be used by professional soldiers
- native Aliens on the planet randomly attacking you in lategame would give a thrill; they could even enter the base via creating an opening on any room with their acid and leaking oxygen from that room until you repair it.
- points of interests on the planet that you have to visit with your ships, kill aliens or humans, claim loot, level up, etc
- raid/attack/capture/enslave other colonies, interact with other colonies, setup regular trades with other colonies
- campaign of conquering hostile planets with multiple bases to support establishing colonies on more hostile environments (ex: trading with your own other colonies go at a better rate, you can get limited stuff for half of the price, etc)
- buildings that regulate heat of very cool or hot planets giving a new dimension of problems to be solved...
- terraforming tools/buildings to actually have a GOAL, making the planet hospitable
- buildings that are for glory should attract better paying visitors
- recreational buildings should attract better paying visitors
- new luxury buildings for even better paying visitors
- underground buildings to be protected from meteors & save space and more creative base building
- direct orders for people or first person control of them (fight intruders in first person)
- different mineable/tradeable minerals
- trader ship building & managing your own traders
- more needs for colonists (ex: bladder - fixed by bathroom, social - fixed by chatroom talk with relatives on home planet, etc...)
- unusable bot recycling to save all those precious materials
- more bot types to eventually replace all colonist functionality (biologist, medic, combat & mechanical robots)
- ability to order colonists for money
- have traders with better prices time to time as they are extremely overpriced
- being able to sell bots to traders, this one is pretty much the most annoying thing that you can only buy them at ridiculous price but can't sell them at all... what?! no trader wants a droid?! are you serious or just trying to annoy the hell out of your players?

Music:
Some people complain about the music - I actually do enjoyed the music a lot, but I ended up turning it off as it is a neverending repetition. But this is a minor thing, I don't expect games to have complete OST's, anyone can put on some background music for their own liking...

In overall I'm very sad that a good idea is sinking in the toilet for the lack of content.
And yeah, it has decent graphics - that doesn't help being the game terribly boring.",1488223848,1488312509,False,84,2,0.7811415791511535,27,True,False,False,False,,1489088019.0,"Hi there,

Thank you for your feedback, we always read customer reviews and try to improve the game besed upon them, at this stage we won't add anything dramatic to it, but we are working on a new update and will release a few fixes.


Just to reply to your points:

> The speed of the game is almost always at maximum, yet still have the bored feeling of having to wait for way too long (half an hour?!) for anything to happen.

If things are proceeding slow, it means your base might not be not optimal, you could try to improve the troughput of your producion chains and make sure things run more smoothly. I've played the game for more than 600 hours and can barely cope with the game at max speed on the easiest planet: If you find yourself waiting around, you might want to try to increase the output of Ore, Metal and Bioplastic in your colony, by redesigning it so it is more efficient.


> Turning on or off structures to reduce electricity usage.

You can do this in one go in the grids panel, you can use the shortcut to do this with one key press + one mouse click.


> I can even ignore emergencies as I can't really interact with them and a redundantly built base just survives anything.

Yes, that would be the idea, build your base correctly and things handle themselves.


> Counting the pixels between dorm room bunk beds when placing them in order to be able to achieve 100% bunk bed count per dorm room - pretty annoying and boring.

Surely one bed more or less in a Dorm os not going to make a massive difference? Just make another dorm and build more beds there.


> Interface for colonist hiring should have a disable colonist type option as I have been setting one type to 100% so many times to avoid random spawning, it would be easier to block the ones that I don't need actually.

There is no need to do this, the percentages in this screen are the desired percentages in your colony, not the percentages of people arriving. So just choose your desired percentages and the game will automatically bring as many people of a particular specialization as required.


> Sometimes I want to see the base, but can't. The camera is way too restricted. You can only have a hint of the nice sky above your planet as the game doesn't let you to change the view angle at all.

There are some mods that allow you to do this, it's just not in the main game as the sky is not detailed enough to be shown fully. You can still see your whole base by putting the camera on top of a hill a bit far from it.


> How are the challenge missions?
> They turned off most of the game features and made you wait even more. The challenge is about patiently waiting to stockpile the resource needed to win. Very boring.

Most of the challenges (except for the last one), can be completed very quickly if you follow the right strategy, waiting for a long time is just one way of completing them ;)


> AI bug for biologists:
> Biologists are not prioritized during starvation, making it a chain reaction

The idea here would be redundancy, if you have a few scatered domes with separate groups of biologists in the this should never happen.


> Trading?
> The way trading works is just highly unprobable. In a real world scenario a trader wouldn't land on your planet unless he is absolutely sure that you will trade with him.

I will give you that, but this is a game, and if we followed a 100% realistic pattern with everything it probably wouldn't be that much fun :)


Thanks again for your feedback and ideas.

First of all I just want to also mention that I do like the style they went for with the player and npcs models and the clothing in game is actually not bad in terms of having some pretty good aesthetically pleasing however the actual world itself just isn't great at all, the graphics look outdated as fuck for the backgrounds and in general the camera controls feel very stiff and clunky.

Besides the dialogue being stiff this game also doesn't do anything innovative with it's combat system which like a lot of other MMORPGS it's clearly following a runescape sort of design that a lot of them follow but just isn't even comparable to runescapes system since the main ui for the different tabs is overcrowded as fuck and isn't helpful in the slightest, it is also really annoying to have to constantly go through said menu.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone even those who are really into MMORPGS personally rate Save yourself the frustration and play literally any other game. 
Overall my personal rating for this game is: 4/100",1710394375,1710403755,False,1,2,0.5020747184753417,0,False,False,False,True,,1710521365.0,"Thank you for your feedback. All Artix Games have a similar tone and dialogue, which is meant to be fun, engaging and humorous. We always use a lot of puns and memes in our games, and AQ3D is no exception.

We understand that AQ3D’s stylized graphics aren’t for everyone; we’ve tried to keep the spirit of 3D MMOs alive with our current look. While a more modern look isn’t out of the question for AQ3D, our team is proud of our legacy and we are happy to honor it with our current graphics.

I was looking at Football Manager and other spreadsheet type management sims, but this really isn't that.  A lot of people reference it being like X-COM (possibly my favorite PC game of all time), but it's essentially a simple tabletop game with RPG elements - your players will level up and acquire not only better ratings for passing, shooting, tackling, and ball control, but also roles and traits that become MASSIVELY important.  I'll admit to still not being very good at this game yet, but I'm still so happy to score a goal or grind out an ugly draw that I keep wanting to play more.

The game is bolstered by slick presentation and charming cartoon player models, not to mention a wealth of customization and community editing options.  (There are plenty of Steam Workshop downloads for real-life leagues and kits).  

If I had a criticism of FTG after the first few hours, it's probably that the gameplay itself can feel repetitive and there actually isn't that much to do in the menus.  Yes, it's a full-featured franchise mode with player transfers, but the transfer window is closed most of the time.  So, if your team is bad, you basically have no recourse but to grind out XP week after week and manage player development.  We're looking at another DLC package in late 2021, so I will be interested to see if the dev considers how to make this a richer long-term experience.

That aside, I'm very pleased with this game.  If you've played FIFA into the ground, and aren't ready to hand your life over to Football Manager, FTG is a clever, satisfying alternative.

We have added a tutorial to the 0.95 update which addresses all of the game's features and provides assistance. 

The game is admittedly hard and has a steep learning curve. Requires a careful approach if you wanna thrive, not just survive.

I would recommend crafting a stone axe and an improvised bag out of materials you can find ANYWHERE on the Island. 
Also, try playing on a private server with loot boosted to get the hang of the game before going on an official server.

Furious Angels is a game developed and published by MorfeoDev

The game has some really beautiful environments and the graphics are really well designed and laid out. The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nontheless

The game also suffers with some weird bugs and glitches which the developer seemed to have overlooked but they don't hinder the game at all

Furious Angels overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts and a good adventure game to play especially if you like fast-paced action games such as this one!

It seems like solid game, just not built for VR experience.

Pros:
This game gives a solid 'man in space' feel (as long as you do not look inside man made structures). Overal atmosphere is solid.

Cons:
1. Movement. You can't push yourself of surfaces, you can't use environment to decelerate, you can't attach yourself to surfaces. I might have a relatively high 'VR in space' movement standards, but I feel like these ones are definition of what movement in space should be like.
2. VR games in general tend to favor interactions with environment, in this game there are no VR-like interactions. You see container with oxygen - you look at it and press 'A', it just changes color to dark and your tank indicates that it got more gas. Items that you pick up with 'A' just disapear. You click on a panel and item appears. There are no on-screen buttons. Lack of interaction is notiecable and immersion breaking.
3. Controls. These are not controls for VR spacesuit, but controls made for keyboard and mouse that were mapped to controllers. While I agree with overal control type (you need to engage thrusters to rotate or move), I think controls (at least for oculus controllers) could have been done better.
4. Environment. Most structures do not give a feel of something made for space and do not add properly to environment. Lots of unused surfaces, bare walls and ceilings, most things are uselesly huge (I understand that spacesuit is large and need large passages, but not everything). Not enough 'fillers' be that toilets, tables, suit locker, equipment or whatewer else. Example: the most defining feature of airlock are two large screen (one with vent below) and how bare it is: no railings, no places to lock cargo, no ports where suits were supposed to connect their safeties or life support, no override ports or notiecable access hatches.",1588502552,1588506113,False,11,0,0.6280229687690734,0,True,False,False,False,,1588605814.0,"Hi andreykl, thank you for your valid feedback.

Sorry you feel upset about the Loveable Rogues DLC, however, this was originally an early adopters bonus like a pre-order bonus, no extra work has gone into it since launch. People who bought the game in the first week of launch got it for free and it became on sale since then.

Maybe from the devs or people who were hyped?

I just discovered this game today and I find it quite boring. 
And I don't like how the game plays or looks;
Firstly you have all these outlines around your characters and things you can interact with.
This might be handy, but it makes exploring boring; you know excactly where you can search for loot.
It also takes away the immersion. I was hoping for a more realistic look like Fallout 1 or 2.
I would also like to have more control of my character than just clicking where he needs to go. 
This would have made combat more fun.
I give the game a 2 / 5 stars rating.

Crossout is a free to play game, and many players enjoy it just like that, without purchasing any packs. Purchasing a pack can save some time in obtaining a certain part or a weapon you want, but it won't guarantee winning: Crossout is a game of skill, and the success in battles relies heavily on your personal fighting style and correctly chosen tactics and weapons/builds for that style. Also teamplay can add a lot. 

Everything the packs contain can be obtained from the ingame market for the ingame coins players earn for selling their loot or crafted parts on the same ingame market. The same goes for crafting - real money is not required, you use only the ingame currency! 

Also weekend specials sometime include free workbench rental to craft parts and discounted fusion when you need 2 identical parts instead of 3 to fuse them and upgrade the resulting part, so it would be prudent to keep an eye for the announcements about the weekend specials - we make them in our social media, forum and in the game too.",386180

It IS in beta, so you need to realize the story isnt all there, but like most AQ games, it is being worked on while you are playing.
PROS
-nostalgia
-dragon chickens
-tactical (on occasion)
CONS
-LOW EXP (like all AQ games)
-no customizability (unlike other aq games, you cant use the same weapon for ""fashion"", this time it is all for stats)
-You are a weak baby. (you start the game WEAK, like most games, but with the exp not levelling your stats up fast enough and the equipment you get that is only barely pushing you above what you already have, makes this the slowest rise to power you could think of in an MMO.

6 degrees of motion is a term i have heard hurled about a lot, and very rarely is it true or if true very rarely is it good to control, detached uses the motion controllers in a very good way (once you get used to them) allowing you to control your direction and angle very well.
It is also one of the most beautiful games i have seen (we are starting to raise the bar in visual quality for vr games, as developers get more used to the strengths and weaknesses of the system and as the engines they use get better and better)
 
[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT[/b] 
The area you will be spending most of your time in the single player game is very well designed and the first time you go into space you really well feel somewhat small and insignificant against a large open space of ...well space.
Oh man that feeling as you look across at a huge asteroid beside you and see your shadow as it sails across it, tiny in comparison. This game really has got some good environments.
Now roomscale…. You are in your space suit and this is done very well so long as you do not move about too much in your physical room, which let's face it you should not do because there is zero gravity and if you want to keep to realism you would not be able to move, but if you do the suit does try to move with you and sometimes it jolts, i also had to use the re-centre button a lot more then i really should of. I tried the game sat down and found i was looking up way too much to make that comfortable.
So if you are stood and do not move about too much in the real world then it is perfect...if you are a fidgeter then be prepared to put up with the odd minor inconvenience (and minor they are)
 
[b]GRAPHICS[/b] 
Again they are great, even when i managed to get an extremely close look at the textures on an asteroid they looked very clear. The assets used are good too. This is one of the higher tier graphical games (i am noticing that Unreal engine seems to be cable of some really nice visuals these days)
 
[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] 
A mixed bag here, first let us clear up one thing, the performance in terms of framerate is spot on, no problem there (though i did lower the pixel density a little due to recording in HD was causing a tiny judder) 
However i experienced two bugs one major and one critical, a door control failed to appear until i left and returned. And the critical one is related to story progression a couple of hours in. To mention the critical one in detail would be a major spoiler, these are bugs that really should not be in a non early access title, but both have been reported and i am sure the developer will fix them.
*EDIT 10/06/17 The critical bug is actually a product of unintuitive design, where the player believes they should do one thing and are meant to do something somewhat crazy. This while still bad is much less bad then a critical bug (and i am told will be fixed in the next two weeks)
 
[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] 
There is a little learning curve but once you grasp how the controls work it is actually really intuitive. No complaints here.

[b]MOTION SICKNESS[/b]
Make sure that your options are set low enough for you pc to not be reprojecting frames and you should be fine. The fact you can see your helmet around you gives you something to ground yourself with and the even though you will feel like you are moving (at one point i was close enough to a wall for the chaperone to appear and for a minute i really thought it was stupid of the game to rotate the chaperone wall with the character i felt that much like i was the one moving….hard to explain). In all honesty though i do seem to have somewhat of an iron stomach when it comes to vr.
 
[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b]
I was unable to test this properly, it has 1v1 multiplayer and the devs did say they could organise a game with them for me to try it, but i wanted to try it as any normal person picking up the game would…. I could not find a single player. Even with a heads up posted on the forum and a 30 to 40 minute wait (not an exaggeration i really did sit and wait for nearly 40 minutes) there was no one playing, get this for its singleplayer content not the multiplayer.
 
[b]PROS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] The movement system is really well done
[*] The atmosphere and feeling of floating in space of being small in a very large area is perfect.
[*] Freedom to achieve your goals in the order you want to do them in.
[*] Graphics are superb.
[*] In my first test i thought i had only played for 15 or 20 minutes, turns out it was double that, sign of a good game!
[*] The developers engage with their users on the forums, can not tell you how important and major that is.
[*] The few cutscenes for the single player are so good. 
[/list]
 
[b]CONS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] No online community.
[*] It is a tad on the expensive side, worth it for the single player but only just, a lower price point may solve the lack of an online community.
[/list]
 
[b]The first try video:[/b]

[b]VERDICT[/b]

The visuals are nice, the VHS vibe with 1980 cyan and pink colors is gorgeous to look at, the story is mystical and interresting but the gameplay is absolutely horrible.

I wish I could say that it's purely skill based, but in the end, luck is the only factor that matters when controling the ship.
Tracks are sloppily put together, there are small gaps in the environment over which you can pass without any problems, fall trough or even get stuck for eternity. Several parts of the track are also based on pure luck with no proper thought put into it. Go to the left and proceed? Or turn right and have absolutely no chance to finish the race because the route you chose was not intended for you to drive on - what kind of gamedesign is this? If it was atleast a tougher route which leads back to the main track, okay - but it was made to kill youor never properly tested.

But the worst part are the controls. The jumping is an absolute desaster. The game never communicates that there is a double jump, however, there is one and you need it - the problem is, it only works in 70% of the cases. Jump height is inconsistent, sometimes the double jump works, at other times it does not at all - it seems too often that if you jump once, the game thinks that you are still in mid-air, even while on the ground for several seconds.... only to have you execute a whimpy leap over an obstacle, killing you.

Unity is an easy to learn engine with a lot of tutorials, games like these have been pulled off flawlessly in the last 30 years so it baffles me how the basic gameplay and controls falls so badly on its face.

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Since then we've been regularly updating the game with 7 major patches, over 80 minor ones and four expansions. As an early access supporter, you even have the first expansion for free, and the second expansion was free for everyone! 

Most importantly the stability and performance of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development in out two-man code team spent patching it up.

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

Primarily, there is a lot of erroneous hit detection which sends objects flying in random directions resulting in you needing to return them to a proper place for the first process. Having to switch between tongs and hammer manually is rather slow and cumbersome, which allows the metal to cool too quickly before you can really begin to work the metal properly, which means another trip back to the smelter so drop the hammer, pick up the tongs, drop the ingot in, find the thermometer and try to the find the spot where the thermometer picks up the temperature, which typically is no where near the ingot. Frankly, I would prefer either a mouse wheel rotation, or a button press to switch between hammer and tongs so those precious seconds aren't lost between forgings. Also, attaching the thermometer to the forge itself and using a method of color on the ingot to determine whether or not it is ready i think would be a much smoother process in the long run.

All in all, the game really captures the concepts of forging quite well, but I think right now it is just missing the mark on transitioning comfortably between tools and awkward hit detection.

The major gamebreaking issue was fixed and I was able to actually play the game. The game looks pretty well done. Im still not a fan of the stock art, but I can look past that if the game plays well.

I don't have much play time because I'm not interested in playing this game. I am simply play testing it to make sure it works and to suggest features to Commander who I have known for years, to help him put out a better game.

My reviews will always be honest, and to the point. If something is broken.. I'm going to say it.

Currently the game is playable for me, so I think that once he has the chance to bring the price down a bit (can't do it yet) I would play it if old school JRPGs are your thing.



~~Original Review~~

Made it about 2 minutes before a game breaking bug caused me to have to close the game. The sound for the intro video was obnoxiously loud even though I had set all the sound options to 20% before starting.

Wouldn't recommend the game in its current state, especially for $10. Most indie games of this caliber are cheaper.",1505507302,1506476925,True,4,0,0.3809078931808471,7,False,True,True,False,,1506437071.0,"This is a very detailed review that I can accept.

I spent most of my time playing on my phone. This review isn't entirely objective, because there are somethings that may not be bad overall, but just bug me the wrong way. 
tl;dr I was really excited about the game, but I wouldn't recommend the game at it's current state.

Cons:
There are elements of p2w. Which I will explain in detail in the text below.
Areas are a little unbalanced. 
There are huge class balance issue.
The game feels like it's in Alpha - lots of unfinished stuff. (more on that below)
PC version could use a new UI with a normal hotbar, instead of using the phone's UI, which is really weird and annoying.

Pros:
Cross-platform.
Has potential.
Well optimized. It's only 50-60 mb and it doesn't take a lot of resources to run. 

I used to play AQ a long time ago when I was a kid, then went on to play DragonFable and then AdventureQuest Worlds. I think I've got the general idea of what to expect in this game, considering it's also free to play, just like the previous games, and it's made by a company that exhibits the same core ideas and mechanics in all their games. Before I even entered the game I expected the game to be somewhat grindy, which is exactly what it turned out to be. It follows pretty much the same formulas as the previous games. However this time it's in a 3d format. 

CONS:

-Classes are NOT balanced. (I haven't tried out the Guardian yet, it's a premium class)
From my experience Mage right now is overpowered. The class can kill a target before it even comes into attack distance. 

-There are elements of p2w. Which I will explain in detail below -
You want to heal, bruh? Well, you can't. Potions in the game are bought only with premium currency. While writing this I wanted to see how they work.(You receive 10 potions for free at the start at the game.) They restore a small amount of your health and have no cooldown. Essentially if you have the cash, you are immortal.
Currently there are 4 classes. For those of you unfamiliar with the game, you can equip classes like an item. Equiping the class brings new skills along with it. The classes right now are Rogue, Warrior, Mage, Guardian. You cannot heal with any of the classes that are freely available, you can only heal with the Guardian which is a premium class. 

-Areas are a little unbalanced. 
After I finished the prologue quests I was teleported to the town of Battleon. I was level 2. The first area outside of the town already has monsters that are level 4. In terms of other MMOs this wouldn't mean much, but here you'll get your ass beat if you fight with monsters a few levels higher than you. The issue mainly here is that they made the spawn to be around trees. You've got a tree with 2 level 2 lizards which you need for a quest where you have to kill 15 of them. What you'll need to do, which i found out after walking around for 5 minutes, is to shake/attack the nearest tree so that they can spawn. Maybe I've been left with the wrong impression, but that's what happened with me.

-The game feels like it's in Alpha.
Don' take this as a huge con, really. The situation is actually good.  Let me explain. 
The town of Battleon has around 5-6 buildings. Some of them still haven't been completed and you cannot enter. When you try to enter, a window pops-up showing what the building will be. That shows that the devs at least have something planned, which will surely be implemented in the future. 

-PC version could use a new UI with a normal hotbar, instead of using the phone's UI, which is really weird and annoying.
It just feels like a mobile game on a PC with that UI. The devs should really try to think of a UI for the pc gamers. 

-You are limited about how many dungeons you can do.
Not sure what they were thinking here.

PROS:

-Cross-platform. 
Really cool if you want to play on the go. 

-Has potential.
It sure does, but it depends on how the devs will do from now on. Hopefully it won't turn really p2w.

-Well optimized. It's only 50-60 mb and it doesn't take a lot of resources to run. 
Enough said.

Similarly, your character offers up sanity checks and just-helpful-enough advice such as, ""I'm not here to fix that"", so you know you don't need bang your head against the wall trying to fix it.

This may be the first point-and-click adventure game since I first got access to the internet, where I didn't get so frustrated with a puzzle that I gave up and looked it up. Sometimes you just need a little nudge in the right direction to know where to apply yourself without giving away the solution, and Primordia walks that fine line well.

In addition to the style, setting, and great voice acting, the story outdoes itself with multiple endings that involve doing different solutions to the end puzzle, instead of just letting you pick a different dialog choice (though a few of those are on the table as well).

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

This review is based on Alpha version 0.0.2.4. I was getting tired of the game by the end of mission 2, but kept going until the midway point of mission 4. 

Overall: Good with frustrating controls and annoying enemies.

Pros: 

- Music is passable. I don't hate it at all and the trance style they used makes it easy to forget how long one is playing. Very good choice since this is mostly a 2d puzzle platformer.

-Nice quality of life for the upgrades to choose from, ranging from faster oil recharge to extra damage for the 3 weapons and additional health.

-Great having a cheat sheet in game to tell the player if they found everything.

-Great layout design for enemy location and trap placement. You will need to learn all the tricks to pass certain areas effectively.

Cons:

- Controls are very stiff. Weapon can only be pointed straight one way, which is fine if there wasn't floating balls of goops rushing at the player. The jetpack allows for multiple boosts in mid air, but as soon as contact is made on the ground, it takes close to 1.7 seconds to be able to jump again, adding artifical difficulty to some areas.

- The game pretty much requires finding the secret areas for upgrade tokens, The upgrades are vital, making the secret areas more like mandatory areas.

- No significant indicator of when a level ends. The only clue players have is the screen stops scrolling while you see an opening. This is important due to having to replay the entire level over again if you missed the upgrade points on the current level.

- There is no backtracking in the campaign. This combines with the previous two complaints and should be highlighted.

- Save spots in the game cannot be reactivated, so if you activate the beacon before entering an important room such as a location with an upgrade capsule, you'll have to do it all over again on death and that is horrible design considering how difficult the controls make it to survive until the next save spot. Please make a manual save when arriving at those hubs.

Conclusion ------------------------
Great idea for a game with some troublesome attributes that will hopefully be corrected as the game is in development. As of now, I cannot recommend the game due to the problems with the game in it's current state. I do recommend keeping an eye of the game because it shows promise. All the negatives I had are minor fixes for major faults with the game, which is great to see for an Alpha release since those can be quick to fix as the game is being worked on.",1469977111,1473396357,True,1,0,0.0,0,False,False,True,False,,1473440507.0,"Thank you for updating your review.

I think the reason why the last level was so difficult for a lot of us was because it seemed to combine more concepts all at once than the previous levels. My inability to imagine the circuit's flow in its entirety is on me, but perhaps if there were more mini-levels prior to this one that introduced the concept of current flow being reversed in the same wires (for example, the way neutral wires work in AC), it would have helped more fellow struggling gamers (or smooth-brained folks like me) to progress easier.

Having said that, my curiosity for starting my own electronics projects has been piqued.

I was very excited about this game.  I absolutely adore resource management games and civ simulations.  I've played for a few hours, starting over dozens of times, trying to find that perfect build that will get my colony seed going.  I love that it's difficult and your decisions matter.

Then it happens.  Maybe an hour into a map, and the AI just gives up.  Out of my 7 starting colonists, 6 of them are hungry.  There's piles of unprocessed food in the storage building waiting to go into the processor, and no one will move it.  ONE lonely engineer will stop what he's doing, grab some veggies or meat and takes them to the machine for himself.  He eats, and then goes back to his tasks.

There is no way to schedule or rank work.  (The max build queue is kind of a joke.)  There is no way to manually assign tasks or override a colonists broken path.  A sandstorm hits, and I have a colonist that walks out side and just stands there in it for no reason.   My bots finally broke down.  One engineer walks right by, and the other is standing right next to it, but refuses to attempt repairs.  I have piles of spare parts and materials waiting to be used.

If a game doesn't have a strong AI to actually simulate well, it needs to allow for granular manual control.  This does not.  Once you've reached an equilibrium the game just stops working.  I love difficult and challenging games.  This isn't a challenge, this is an infinite loop of broken.  All in all it's a very simple game that had the promises of complexity, but failed to deliver.   I would say the AI is a joke, but there would actually have to be an AI to rate.

I have supported AE on kickstarter and have followed many of the updates as time went on, I waited to write this review as I know developing a game takes time and the small team making the game is learning as they go. 

I am going to break this review down into 4 sections: my thoughts, current state of the game, the possible future, and suggestions. 

My thoughts:
I have played and still play aqw to this day and have spent a ton of money supporting what I think is a game with massive potential. The core mechanics of aqw is to do quests, fight monsters, and level up to obtain more powerful classes. The complexity of the fights are simplistic, but are still engaging as some bosses require multiple people to defeat. The art is amazing for a 2d flash game, its some of the best you'll ever find in my opinion. The game rewards hardcore players with gear that provides bonuses like a weapon that does 51% more dmg to all monsters. The end game is very grindy, but makes up for it by rewarding the player with amazing gear. 

However, the longer I played I realized that I wanted more complexity in regards to the classes as the gameplay loop became repetitive and I had nearly collected all the cosmetics and gear I had wanted. When I first heard that AE was realesing a new game, this time a 3d one, I got really excited at the possibilities of new class mechanics, some that could be complex and add creative new ways to play the game. 

Current state of the game:
The gameplay is level up and rank up your classes to become more powerful. The more powerful you become the more classes you can unlock. Each class has 5 main skills (cross skill included) alongside a few passive upgrades. The gameplay loop over time becomes repetitive as 5 skills is not much to experiment with, fights are simplistic as the player can spam skills and still come out on top in most fights. The trade skills are not worth going for as they do not benefit the player in game in any meaningful way. For example, old school runescape is a game made by a small team and leveling certain skills unlocks shortcuts in game to help the player bypass certain areas improving gameplay. The social aspect of the game is hurt by the low population playing the game as many old areas will be barren, I feel as if veteran players should have an incentive to go back to old areas. The content updates are a bit too slow, I have been waiting for housing to come for years. I know the development of a game can take time, but with no progress plan to show players and reassure them it feels like I am waiting for something that may never happen. I am not going to talk much about the free to play aspect of the game as I think AE is doing a decent job at making it fair for f2p players. 

I love AE as small indie companies with heart seldom exist anymore, but I feel like the game is falling short of what it could be. 

The possible future:
The game is lackluster for the amount of time it has been out, but that does not mean there are no positives. The games art I find quite charming and unique. The story in the game is great and easy to follow. However, for the average player who has not been with AE for years this will be something that they stop playing after 5 hours or so due to the aforementioned issues above. The updates add new areas, but with the same quest structure that reward players with things that do not change game play in any way. 

Some suggestions: 
-add a few more skills to the classes (players can unlock one new skill at a time and slowly ""master"" a certain class)
-make battles in general more complex (players might need to combo skills in a certain way or use a specific skill at the right time)
-add meaningful rewards that showcase a players skill or dedication (like a cape for reaching the highest level in fishing) or maybe reward players with a fishing rod that can catch more fish or unique fish that craft into endgame weapons.
-incentivize old players to revisit old areas so they are not barren when new players start to progress through the game 
-Maybe focus less on cosmetics and more on changing and add features in the game based on in game surveys 

Many of my friends laugh at me for still playing this game, but I laugh back because I know AE never drops or gives up on their games. This game can improve, I simply feel as if it may take too long before its too late :(",1561835286,1645167396,False,1,0,0.5024875402450562,1,False,False,False,False,,,,429790

I am hoping technical support can now fix this for me as it is an requirement to fully experience the game now all a sudden.

Other then that it's a fun game with extremely pricey parts you can buy for real money, it is how ever not pay to win. If you don't want to pay (and even if you do) the grind is real. Expect to put in a lot of hours to get to where you want to be.

Also expect every weapon you get to get nerfed soon after, there is a reason you want that weapon, it's because it's powerfull at that moment.

Lot of good people in the game, but ofcourse also some that are just toxic.
The building system is awkward still not having mirrored building and modules that are odd sizes.
In the end most players use nearly the same looking builds because of that.

There are also some weapons that you can hardly play without using hovers.
And then there is the annihalator drone that 3/4th of the builds can't do anything against.

So sadly at this moment i can not recommend playing this.



2022 update :
After a lot more hours of addictive playing they just changed the codrivers with which they destroyed littlerly 99% of my builds, and they added a legendary artillery cannon that can 1 shoot you.
Player count is dropped so much they are evevn working on joining console and pc players together to keep the game going to milk it for a bit longer.

Thank you for the thorough feedback, I'd like to answer about some of the issues you have described.
First and foremost, we apologize for the inconvenience with the 2 step authentification, but we think it is vital for keeping your accounts safe from phishing frauds etc. Please contact our tech support if something in the process of setting it up seems confounding, we'll be glad to help.
Speaking of the game: yes, you are right, it is free to play and purchasing packs won't guarantee wins as players need skills in the battles to win. As for the grind, please pay attention to the weekend specials: they can feature free workbench rentals or discounted upgrades, when you need only one identical item to upgrade your part. Also trawling the market for good deals proves to be a good way to get something cheaper.
We rebalance the game not only by diminishing some characteristics, but also by upping them and do this to make the playing field more variable in builds and weapons without everyone going for the same narrow meta. I hope you understand this, we believe it is way more fun when people have wildly different weapons of choice on the battlefield.
Please report toxic people via the ingame report button or on our game forum, we look through the reports constantly and deal with the people who break rules.
I hope you'll be happy to hear the mirroring building feature is in the works and will be introduced in one of the future updates. As for odd sizes of modules - could you please elaborate on that? Which modules and what could be changed about this size? The dev team takes such criticisms into consideration and rework different parts, but we'd appreciate more information to work with.

Foundation is in essence a sandbox game where the player makes there own goals to some extent. So there is no real endgame. That being said we will continue to add more content as well as more diverse and in depth narrative events and missions that will punctuate the gameplay.

In time we hope we can earn a positive review.

Cheers

The most frustrating issues are unbeatable levels due to the semi-random level design. Some of the level pieces simply do not fit together, rendering the levels impossible to complete.

EDIT for the dev response:

The two main bugs I had to deal with playing this game last night:
1. Weapon not firing. I ran into this one a few times. It appears to resolve itself when you pick up another weapon. But there were times where I could not locate any other weapons to fix the bug (do to being unable to fire) and had to reset the run.

2. Enemies appearing behind the walls. This MAY not be a bug technically, but it feels like one. I had multiple instances where I could not find enemies that I could clearly hear. That's normally not a big deal, as the only consequence is that you will miss out on the end-level bonus. However, I had to deal with a red orb that endlessly generates exploding green orbs around the player until it is killed. I dashed through the entire level multiple times looking for it, could never find it. A slow, miserable death for that level. Again, maybe not a bug, maybe just really poor design?

3. Level design in general: Perhaps the issue is not the procedural generation creating literally impossible variations (that was simply my guess, dev says it's ABSOLUTELY FALSE, so alright). A few times, I found myself trapped in the levels with no clear exit. This IS due to the procedural design. The pieces may technically fit together, but the variations do not present a visual language that the player can consistently interpret for navigation. The map does help to an extent, but the game starts introducing verticality and alternative zones (e.g. under sewer gates), which makes the map less useful. There were times where instead of running through the entire level looking for what I missed for the 20th time, I just restarted the level to save time. Was it a bug? Or is it simply bad design? I will let the dev decide.

I have enjoyed the game to an extent, and love the very creative concepts employed. However, the end experience was simply too frustrating for me to recommend.",1650765402,1650813020,False,0,0,0.478723406791687,0,True,False,False,False,,1650769766.0,"I'm sorry you didn't enjoy the game, but this is absolutely false.",1051690

Remove the play gate. There's plenty of DLC for people to support the game. From the 40 minutes I got out of the game it seems you could really use the player base.

I found that as I leveled up I was provided increasingly more gas to the point where I no longer found it to be a hard limit. I even saw my gas get refilled automatically from certain circumstances (level up, event actions, etc).

War for the overworld plays and feels very much like dungeon keeper 2 did in my opinion, which can't have been an easy task. Of course it does'nt quite possess the magical charm of DK2 visually, and particularly in the sound department. For example; the little touches on DK2 such as the sound when you claim ground, the beating of the dungeon heart, the battle music etc...but its still very good and enjoyable and unique in its own way.

They clearly had a lot of passion developing this and doing their up most best to make it feel as close to the bullfrog series as possible. But they have included some nice extra's to make things a little more in depth which can only be appreciated.

It takes an enormous amount of time, staff and resources to create a MMO from scratch. Our small but mighty team of developers create, plan, develop, program, 3D model, write and test the game in house - we don't have any outside help (except for our amazing team offsite!), so it will take time to build the world of Lore within AQ3D but we feel we have so far created a wonderful, fun, engaging, and entertaining game - that has weekly releases and will continue to be developed for years to come!

AQ3D is definitely not like other MMOs - our company has never played by the normal 'rules' of creating games - we like taking risks, doing crazy events and releases and love using puns. We are definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but will continue to release fun, exciting, wacky and memorable content. And the fact we have weekly releases - and continue to grow, develop and evolve the game along with player suggestions and feedback. 

The devs are constantly working on fixing and improving issues and releasing updates/patches weekly, which is a challenge as an indie game studio. Please check out the Game Plan and Design Notes - https://aq3d.com/news/ & https://aq3d.com/game-plan/.",429790

I felt like I was fighting with this game almost every step of the way. I started off with a look at the [b]options[/b] which were pretty [b]minimal[/b], the game has a few graphical tweaks with a res ""booster"" (which I like, especially when the game ignores your SteamVR SS settings.) I left things at default which were high with base 100% res scale. The only gameplay options are toggle on/off for screen shake and pitch invert.

The game [b]looks very dated[/b], which is only made worse by the fact that it [b]runs poorly[/b] too. I had some stutters, it spent most of its time at 60fps (was set to 120Hz which it clearly was unable for) and even a few freezes. On my second session, I tried at 90Hz and it did at least spend most of its time there, but the odd stutter and rare freeze still happened. 9700k/2080ti/32gb/ssd.

First up, I went into test flight, which I thought would be an ok place to start - it wasnt. As I looked around my cockpit, about 10 seconds in I started to get flashing covering the right half of my screen as if I was being shot or hitting an invisible world barrier (I was still in the hangar!), ship died, started again. This time I thrust immediately out of the hangar, but as I got to the mouth, I have no idea how, but my ship acted like I hit something (I was as clear as I could be, having flown straight forward the short ~20 meters to the exit) and my ship spun and exploded. Take 3, I got out of the hangar and was blasted down in about 20 seconds. Ok, not the place to start!

Next, I went to basic tutorial, its almost entirely dialog driven with next to no visual ques. Its not uncommon for 2 messages to be playing at once. A bug that I thought was so annoying I stopped to look up if anyone reported it and if it might be fixed - found threads on it dated 2017 (pancake version), so I wouldnt hold my breath on that one :/ There is a good list of tutorials, I did just a few.

I then tested out how the game works with different controls. The short answer is terrible. It supports a range of input devices, but if you dont use a gamepad, enjoy having to bind everything. On keyboard/mouse, only WASD is set, not a single other key seemed to do anything, while its nice that you can rebind, it seems criminal to not have a basic profile for different methods setup, I dont mind tweaking things, but having to set a key for everything?! The knuckles (/Index controllers) were strange, pressing right on the right thumbstick selected things on the menu, and in game it had dual functions, so while you want to pitch down you kept getting spammed the scan function, or rotating right you were spammed with the matching speed function. Thats not even the worst part!! When you tried to rotate, you were jerked usually 5-10 degrees in *either* the direction you were trying to turn to, or the opposite (before then rotating correctly), so if you wanted to subtly turn 30 degrees and did so by touching the stick a few times - grab yo nausea medication.

The gamepad worked fine and things were mapped nicely. It is the input I would recommend anyway since the motion controllers are not tracked and only act as a gamepad anyway.

Finally, I gave the campaign a go. After a short video which is shown on a small floating screen (I dont mind this honestly, I would rather when devs are porting a game from pancake to VR to put the time in pretty much anywhere else than try redo cutscenes) and mission briefing while sat in VR, I was on my way. It started to feel a little like fun :O I managed to fly out of the hangar without exploding (noice!) and was given instructions to escort some ships. No problem! It was a pretty sleepy affair, after a few minutes I was told there was a ship(/blip) lurking around some asteroid and it was go time! Kinda. There was 1 ship, which took me a minute and a half to find (probably my fault, as I had no idea I could scan a near target - no controls are shown and I didnt get down through the tutorials, so maybe its in there somewhere), easy kill, on with the mission. 2 minutes of more sleepy flight and we arrive at what I am assuming was the destination because everyone kept flying around it. I must absolutely suck, because I couldnt see what I had to do for the life of me. I genuinely spent 10 minutes looking around the station, looping around it and scanning, flying to where I thought the game wanted me to go, flying next to each of the container ships... nothing happened. Got annoyed, started to fire at the ships! Was given out to (fairly lightly tbh!) Destroyed 1 of 3, no warnings or HUD changes happened, so I started to fire at the second! I figured at this point if I cant complete this mission I am going to fail it in style. As I fired at the 2nd ship I got a message which sounded like my shields were depleted? Dont know how or why, but I was no longer able to fire or fly! I could look around, but not thrust, or roll, or ..... I gave up!

So, I even failed at failing! What a perfect way to end!

After that experience, I just cant recommend this game.

Edit: i see complaints about how the game is a grind fest and how all the money is going towards devs making cosmetics... I like this game because it reminds me of WoW or Runescape, or even diablo from when i was a child.. and its simple enough that it allows my kids and younger family members to play, and i can play with them, way better than them unsupervised on fortnite... it gave my kids a taste of what i used to experience and the wonder i felt exploring worlds in similar games from my hay day, 20+ years go...

again, great game, simple... easy to pick up for kids, allows me to experience it with a younger generation, and allows them to enjoy what i used to enjoy. The overall cartoony, fun themes make it a winner for me because i can play it casually or in a competative fashion as well.

I also like the fact that I can hand my kid my cellphone and he can play with me rather than he using my office with my gaming machine and my business machines...especially in a remote work situation...

I personally do not invest in the gaurdian thing, I am too casual for that, but i have purchased crystals for the little ones... its not any worse then the kids begging for robux or vbucks.. the f2p is fine for me and there is a lot they offer. and the kiddo can even earn free crystals by watching ads on the mobile app version of the game...

Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We do indeed plan to add more challenges to the game before the full release. We also plan more depth alongside more and deeper missions/quests.

There is still much more to come for the game and we hope you enjoy the development and improvements.

Also, great to hear you are enjoying the sound design!

The gameplay loop closely resembles the gameplay of Subnautica. However, because Breathedge is hell-bent on convincing the player that all of their actions are meaningless, the gameplay becomes tedious, and because resource gathering tools in Breathedge are essentially one-excursion-use, the game becomes TOO tedious. Too many times I had to leave at the climax of a ""main quest"" type mission, run through empty hallways for 10 minutes, build the tool or ""Useless garbage the devs made so you could proceed"" (I'm not kidding, this happens multiple times). This sort of humor happens so often that I can't help but feel like the story was seriously neglected, or as an excuse for poor level layout. There are genuine moments where this sort of humor hits, but it isn't at all balanced by the solemness of the setting, and the constant breaking of the fourth wall serves only to enhance the feeling of tediousness. 

Spoiler Example: You need to run through a long, empty airplane hanger, and then two long, empty hallways, and down some stairs, only to be told you need to build something to proceed. So you backtrack up the stairs, through the two long hallways and one empty plane hanger to your base, build the item, and return. 

Oh wait! That's only if you had the correct tool with you, when you made your first trip down, because there was a resource you needed to gather that was located at the bottom of the stairs. 

So, if you don't have that tool, you need to run through a long, empty airplane hanger, and then two long, empty hallways, and down some stairs, then backtrack up the stairs, through the two long hallways and one empty plane hanger to your base, build the resource gathering tool, then run through the long, empty airplane hanger, two long, empty hallways, and down the stairs, collect the resource, backtrack up the stairs, through the two long hallways and one empty plane hanger back to your base, build the item, run BACK through a long, empty airplane hanger, and then two long, empty hallways, and down some stairs, and use the item to proceed. The thing that gets me is that the developers knew this was a hassle for the player, because the game offers for the player to fast travel, runs a loading screen, and then informs the player that unfortunately there is no fast travel. This punchline is pretty funny, but I didn't really enjoy the build up of the joke, which was [i]the player not having any fun for 20 minutes.[/i]

Unfortunately that is where the problem with this title is as well.  I would not so much say that this game isn't recommended.  It just is not worth the price that it currently goes for.  When this goes on special (75% off at least)- take it.  
It does have replayability in exactly the same sence as the old dungeon keeper games had - that is to say, doing exactly the same over and over again (because it was fun).  For me, this doesn't translate so much in modern gaming.  
Further more, it was a massive surprise to learn that coop wasn't available for the campaign.   The campaign itself is rather easy and very short.  Skirmish and sandbox modes are pretty much just free for all bash - ups being made moderately fun by the swathe of different map designs out there.

Does this game succeed in what it sets out to do?  Absolutely.  It brings an old, nostalgic experience into modern times.  That in itself begs the question - do you buy this game or get Dungeon Keeper 2 to work on your current os?  The latter wont cost you any money and all you sacrefice is the graphics.

Technically this game is a disaster.  It chews up pc resources equal to something double its size and depth.  The graphics are pretty, particles are sweet and animations are ""okay"" - yet this beast eats up more resources on both my pc's than just about anything I have.  I'd go so far as to suspect that there may be some serious memory leakage going on or just not very clever design.

Again, this game isn't all that bad but I can find very few reasons to recommend it based on its current price.  As someone who played dungeon keeper for years, this game could hardly provide me with any reason to do so beyond 5 hours (that is how long it took me to complete the campaign).   Mind you, it appears the average playtime for the campaign varies between 6 to 12 hours, so do not use my time as the average.  Some of us grind harder than others :)

Coupled with the lack of any kind of intelligable innovation, the technical presentation of this title is atrocious.  Something ""appearing"" of this quality should at least be half way better designed.  I'm not sure if it is bad resource management or perhaps bias towards more mainstream hardware combinations.  What I can say is that between the group of friends I play with, all of us experience this kind of issue where the game is just hogging an inordinate amount of resources.  Things like this can be polished out with further tweaks from the developers whom appear to be quite active in community engagement (although, i would note in a very quetionable manner not befitting PR).

Multiplayer:
Coop campaigns are not existing yet.  It doesn't look like they will either.
Multiplayer is stock standard player vs player or player & player vs AI (this is what they deem coop - beware those steam tags).  
The game devours resources so you can imagine what a horrible experience multiplayer becomes with 4 players on a large map.  That is, IF you can get the game to work on multiplayer.
Multiplayer requires you to download their little guide (or just go read the resources) so as to unblock the required ports and the likes.  Yes folks, we are talking peer to peer multiplayer.  Not only is this problematic for a whole swathe of players to set up, but (do i need to say this really?) it is NOT SECURE.  Not recommended (dont take my word for it - use google).

In closing,

The game is one of those ""could have beens"".  It could have been great, it could have been really fun.  And, hey, it still is for a few hours.  But not at that price.  You can buy 4 good indie games for the same price that would each provide you four to five times the play time.  
Thus this is purely a title you'll invest in out of nostaliga and nothing else.  Guaranteed.

My recommendation:
Buy it on special!",1465795525,1465795943,False,76,0,0.6626028418540953,3,True,False,False,False,,1530808404.0,"Hi Pixelporn,

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2016. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Most importantly the performance and stability of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development from our two-man code team. 

There is also now the second expansion, the Crucible survival mode, that was free for all! 

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

There really are not a lot of people, compared to other STEAM games, playing CR. It's funner because there are WAY fewer cheaters. WAY fewer.

It is SUPER FUN to beast the piss out of someone with a golden pan.
The Garand and the Thompson Subgun are my other fave weapons.
TONS of great guns in this game. The MG42s mounted in the bunkers can be a highlight of crossing that terrain, remember to stop in and see if anyone is in the kill zone of  the bunker MG. Super satisfying long distance massacre. Use short bursts. People that hold the trigger down find our real quick how few rounds are in that drum.
 
Now I still play a sneaky game, and avoid trouble as though on a recon.
But when the blue zombie noise pushes us all together, lots of guys try to ride their bunny slippers, and they are lurking on roofs.
I kill them with a KAR98 or a Garand. Usually just one good shot with the big 30 cal to 8mm rifles is enough to end the enemy.
Even the .30 carbine is pretty deadly with one or two rounds, if you get the body or head hits.
Scope is not essential, these rifles shoot true with the iron sights also. 

It's also real great, you know, safe and effective, to have a submachinegun of some kind.
ANd sometimes better at the end to have two subguns, or a buttload of ammo for the one you have.
You have to really work at getting enough ammo to be ready for a gunfight in this game.

The one map will surprise you. You think that you know it pretty well by now, but then you end up next to a pond when you have only been in rivers, or a church or ville on the other edge. 

There's a couple of secret things that many current players obviously do not know. They suffer for that ignorance.
I am going to give a couple of clues here, but you have to figure some stuff out yourself to work the system.

A. When the weird noises start, it's annoying. It's also a signal that if you do a thing, or goto a place, it might work out better for you.

B. Get a pan. If you see a pan, and you do not pick up the pan, you are wrong. Not a pot, not a waffle iron, pick up the golden saucepan. It's a whacker, but also does a ninja bullet thing that you like a lot.

3. When in some rooms of buildings ... look up.

And, in the words of my personal gamegod, his STEAM handle is rangersauce, do not forget to:
SHOOT
   LOOT
       and SCOOT

As of right now, it's unintuitive, unoptimised, buggy and generally difficult to play.

I'll start with the things I enjoyed about the game. Starting off on the rioter side in the Arab Spring scenario, I found that the game succeeded in evoking a strong emotional response while also being suitably challenging. It was genuinely disturbing to watch the police units fire indiscriminately into my crowd of peaceful protestors, and even though I ultimately won the scenario, I was still left feeling morose at the thought of the number of people who had died for that victory. I suspect that that's exactly the sort of emotional response that the game is going for, and in that regard, it succeeds.

However, for everything the game has in its ability to evoke the emotions associated with the scenarios it portrays, it lacks far more in its actual design and gameplay. In designing the controls, I suspect that the developers wanted to simulate the chaos and disorganisation in trying to direct people in a riot, but it comes off as feeling sluggish at best and outright random at worst. Targeted abilities, such as projectiles, can either land directly on their mark or fall completely flat, seemingly at random - I'm not expecting a one-hundred percent hit rate, obviously, but any indication at all of factors that could affect my unit's accuracy would be appreciated. 

The various items and abilities you can confer onto your units are not sufficiently explained and lack almost any feedback when they're used - I can give my protestors laser pointers to 'slow down' police units, for example, but there's no feedback to indicate whether the ability actually landed or had any effect, and even if it did, what's the use in making a single hostile unit move slower for a few seconds? Slingshots are supposedly a more potent way of harming police units at range than the rocks and random debris that all mobs have the ability to throw, but targeting them is an exercise in guessing, as is working out if they had any effect whatsoever. The same goes for many other items, and the only way to discover which ones are actually useful is to play and lose a few times before you hit on a winning combo.

This lack of feedback is unfortunately a running theme on both sides of the protest line. Police units can be individually outfitted with different gear, but there is no indication [i]whatsoever[/i] of the pros and cons of different kinds of gear versus one another. What's the difference between a 'crude long baton', a 'wooden stick', and an '18in plastic tonfa'? How is 'Gasmask 2' better than 'Gasmask 1'? Why do my ballistic units have a choice of five different smoke grenade launchers, and again, how do they differ? Why, after I threw aside my moral values in total frustration and gave every ballistic team lethal ammunition, did they kill [i]less[/i] people than when they were using less-than-lethal rubber bullets? The game makes no effort to answer any of these questions, and even after a solid hour of trying different bits and pieces of cop gear to no visible effect (the first hour being spent playing the protestor side), I'm left no closer to finding out.

The game attempts to model the media outlook on a protest event and supposedly punishes the more violent side by giving their opponent a bonus in the next mission, but once again, precious little information is given on how gameplay is affected. After a particularly bloody day in Cairo in which over a hundred of my protestors were shot dead, I was told that my side would have a 'massive advantage' in the next mission. How that manifested, however, is a mystery to me. I was given fewer units to field, a more difficult mission to fulfil, and the police were no less armed or brutal when they turned up to once again to - quite literally - shoot my peaceful protest down. 

Bugs, too, are rife in this game, which is odd after the huge period of delay it was subject to before launch. Protestor mechanics mostly work well, but the police side is barely functional. Riot shield-clad tactical units occasionally flee their positions and concede ground to peaceful, non-aggressive protestors for no discernible reason. Assault units sent in to strategically separate and arrest vulnerable protestors, proceeding to drag them off-screen, sometimes disappear from the map for up to a minute at a time before trickling back onto the field in disarray - were they indulging in police brutality where I couldn't see them or something? Shotgun-toting ballistic units occasionally only fire one or two of the ten guns available to their squad, and whether or not they hit anything is up to factors that the game makes no effort to inform the player of. Units tasked with throwing stun grenades into the crowd will often seemingly have a seizure and flicker from left to right on the spot, trapping their entire squad in inaction until given a new order. When pushed to it, enemy protestors seem to either phase directly through my testudo of riot shields or merge together into one single super-protestor, making them impossible to dislodge from a map area in either case. 

The relatively static camera has trouble following the action in some maps, and I lost one scenario as the protestor side when a police unit charged off the corner of the map, leaving me unable to target them with attacks or abilities even though they were still counted as being inside the 'objective zone' for the game's purposes of resolving the scenario. As for protestor mechanics, I haven't once been able to get the 'build barricade' ability to work - a frustrating problem, as it's the only way that units in the 'aggressive' stance can attempt to hold a position.

There's a few extra modes to toy with in the 'Custom' section of the game, but I had even less luck getting those to work properly. I gave 'spectator' mode (also called 'journalist mode' when you unlock it, for some reason) a go and attempted to pit 400 furious, heavily-armoured, molotov-tossing guerrillas against 120 equally well-armed officers of the law. When I started the game, I was surprised to find that only four rioters showed up. They promptly ran off-screen, handing an immediate and anti-climactic victory to the police. I figure the cops must've been more confused than I was.

The game's performance, particularly for a two-dimensional game with deliberately low-res graphics, is surprisingly poor, particularly when aiming abilities - it goes without saying that trying to drop a molotov on top of a charging police line before they run out of its landing zone is already challenging, and it becomes impossible when the framerate drops into the low single digits. To its credit, the game didn't crash at any point, though it still escapes me how a 900mb game that seems quite undemanding in terms of system requirements can run as poorly as this one does at times.

To conclude: it's a great concept and it certainly succeeded in evoking the emotional response it was surely aiming for, but as a game - as a collection of interlocking mechanics that responds to player input - it has a long road ahead of it. Hopefully, most of the negative points mentioned in this review will be obsolete after a few months of tuning and polishing from the developer(s?). At present, though, I'd advise putting your purchase on hold.",1512591183,1512594027,False,408,10,0.900307297706604,32,True,False,True,False,,1512645294.0,"Hi,

Thanks for this in depth feedback!

It is great to hear your response to witnessing the events portrayed in RIOT.

The targeting issue is something we are working on now and we will have a patch up soon for that. Please keep an eye out for announcements either on the store page or in the News section, we will post bug fix logs there.

You raise the issue of lack of visual feedback. This is mostly intentional as we did try various forms of visual feedback through development. We quickly noticed that with so much being displayed on screen, it quickly became chaotic. We will assess this however and return to it. Regarding laser pointers: There are abilities that the police have to charge and push forward. You can slow them down while you regroup, prepare an attack or construct barricades.
The slingshot point I think comes back to targeting but also visual feedback. We'll address this with an update.

On lethal and other weapons and the outcomes of their usage; It is possible that this would happen because using lethal weapons causes the crowd to disperse. Other weapons would have a reduced effect in this way so more people stay and more violence ensues. Of course, on the surface this seems counter-intuitive but I hope this explains this issue. Regardless, we will look into this. Thanks for the feedback on the item loadouts, these are excellent suggestions and we'll see what we can do.

Thanks for reporting the issue on level difficulty progression. We'll push an update for this soon.

There is a lot to address in the bug reports here. Police fleeing their posision is possible as the fear response is based on group density and numbers. The more dense the crowd, the more sway they have. However I do see that a non aggressive crowd should really not have quite as much control, we can look into patching this. Disappearing from the screen is something we can fix in an update. Shotgun units not using all available shotguns is intentional as a blast from all of them would be overwhelming. However, we can look into addressing this. The impact I believe comes back to targeting. The animation glitch is something we can fix with a patch too. Pushing through the testudo should not be possible and we'll work on that.

We'll work on the camera and barricade construction issues and we'll get an update out for that.

The rioter numbers is a surprising bug! We'll get a patch out for this.

The performance issues you noted are something that we are continuing to work on. The reason why RIOT is extremely resource intensive is that the game, while appearing very light, actually uses a system of AI and collision across each unit. The game calculates all of the physics involved in each interacting with each person you see, the environment and the units as a whole. All of these considerations do lead to a persformace hit, however we will continue to work on improvements.

Thanks again for the review. We'll be sure to list every issue that we address in changelogs that we will share on Steam. You will be able to check out the progress there. Our intention was always so address any issues raised in this Early Access phase but if you return for release to play the game again, we hope you review RIOT again. Hopefully, with a thumbs up!",342310

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game.

Since then we've been regularly updating the game with 7 major patches, over 80 minor ones and four expansions. As an early access supporter, you even have the first expansion for free, and the second expansion was free for everyone! 

Most importantly the stability and performance of the game has been now greatly improved after thousands of man-hours of development in out two-man code team spent patching it up.

If you've not tried the game for a while now might be a great time for you to jump in and see how far we've come since release! We'd love to hear what you think now.

Cheers,
Cian

4 years on from their retail release Elite has stagnated and become quite stale, the first couple of years it was filled with so much content a new thing was happening every month, update refreshes each week brought new lore into the game's background sim engine. Thargoid's were starting to be revealed as well as other ancient races which with their technology left speculation on the future of this game positive. However the hype and the routine updates which led to a game feeling that the rush and thrill would never end found out that was not to be and thus towards the end of 2018 things in game started to slow, we learned of many developers jumping ship and lead designers moving onto other games, PR staff who we had followed and loved to be around saying their farewells. Most thought this was a transition period and gave frontier the benefit of the doubt. 

Soon after the silence started on the forums and in other social media outlets, we had learned Micheal Brookes had also changed his game development to an ""in house"" game in frontier. 
This then opened the forums for the trolls and naysayers who questioned everything. We soon started seeing players we had flying with on expeditions becoming forum moderators overnight and known staff keeping quiet. A period time went by where we the community accepted this and just got with the game playing it part time to keep things moving along hoping frontier would pull a mighty big rabbit of their hat for us. Over hyped expeditions led the way, with players running the show and organising mass player meet ups just to prolong the stale content in the game. Those who stuck around kept believing this would be just temporary thing and frontier would start to generate new updates for the older players with bug fixes. 

There was a lot of hype and buildup to the April 2019 update with frontier as usual promising a load of fixes for known bugs and a new player experience which fell very silent on the community, that new player experience was 4 years to late. Before the update a player who knew a developer in frontier submitted a time line post to reddit just as friendly heads up on the speculation of the future of elite and frontier. A day went by and that person got a friendly request on reddit to remove his post or face legal action by frontier.

We techy folks found a way to see what the reddit post and what was discussed and yes it showed to us in our disbelief that frontier had moved elite into maintenance mode till the latter of 2020 and so future updates planned, the post also went into how frontier were now outsourcing their development on other games, pretty believable if you just know the artists and developers who worked on the thargoid artwork and guardian's stuff like i do, to know this wasnt a one off thing from frontier. Now most people in game now think there is plenty of content most of it is hidden behind mysteries and complex puzzles which only the developers know about. 

Again the post on reddit ended with there is no raxxla. Even drew wagner a storyboard writer and book author recently told the community in a youtube blog that no author who was working with frontier had access to that storyline and it was kept in house and to only 3 people of which are not story writers. They have no idea how to write a story in elite or otherwise. So the statement is very believable yes there is raxxla in the game, its in the code but thats where it stops its no you cannot visit it, no there isnt a gateway to another dimension or galaxy and no its just not in the actual in a playable format. Think of it as being a #raxxla footnote in c++. So Its there in game in the code and Mr braben can rightly state so. Oh just so you know Drew Wagner did fall out with frontier for this as it was as close to breaking his Non disclosure agreement as you can get.

So in a nutshell is Elite Dangerous worth playing.  Yes as long as you paid under 5$ and as long as you know that this game isnt going anywhere despite the hype train telling you which is player created leading you to believe otherwise.

Now with even more broken content they spin more lies about future development and roadmaps which a child could of done in a preschool setting. Sorry but if you have bought the expansion you deserve the guilt, shame and disgust the rest of the community have about Fdev's broken promise scheme.

Yet here we are in 2022 and Fdev are still up to their spin and tricks. David Braben has finally jumped ship knowing full well this is a doomed title.

What seemed like unfinished product with clunky ui proved to have  more dept than I thought, being unrefined to modern tastes but not unfinished.

Ever since then game has improved weekly, problems that are posted are getting fixed and improvements that make gameplay clearer are being added.

I have reported numerous  things about this game and I have noticed they all get fixed in matter of days.

Foresight team doesn't seem to be afraid to do major changes either to not just to make their game sell, but to make it really good.

While I write this review the game still ways to go, but it's the kind of game that grows on you when you give it a chance, improving along the way.

More about the setting : http://foresightrts.com/introduction/


[u]Lets get this party started.[/u]

I have prepared three different secments : Interesting, meh and the "" ""why oh why"" section.



[b]First interesting stuff:[/b]

 [i]Fleet system with levelling commanders [/i]

 Commanders gain passive abilities when their skills improve and they have their own AI personalities, such as defensive,competent, intelligent.

 - You have  fleet bars with  information in them, allowing you to use all your number keys for buildings and scouts while focusing larger groups to fleet F-keys.

- Fleets ask for units and post suggestions: like "" requesting five fighters or want to go sector x"" , you can just double click to approve them.

- Killing fleet commanders hinders your control over them. You need either main hero or alive commander to control fleet.

- Ai controls fleets in combat automaticly hitting their strongest targets and based on commanders personality either flee like chickens or take it like a man.

- Commanders can die and will try to escape to other ships when they are losing.

[i]Unique take to scouting.[/i]

- Every  ship has  limited detection range and larger attack range... because this game has detection units.

- Scouting is vital. Scouts allow you to shoot farther and recon new areas and secure sectors as beacons.

- Dormant mode allows wide area fleets scans. You know what I mean when you try it.

[i] Weaponising resourses [/i]

- You can use stuff like gas clouds as minefields.

[i]Factions [/i]

- UNC  ( United Nations Confederation ) is an anti tecnology faction that uses "" safe"" tecnologies as railguns and missiles, being the "" standard""  faction. Asia based.

-SS ( Slavic Sirerians)""the aliens"" : Use chemicals and bio weapons ( yes  chemicals and bacteria in space.) Are mostly male and somewhat ....manly. Slavic based.

- NSAU ( North-South American Union)  : Is high tec faction that uses beam weapons, shields and .. this one was new to me check it out : Portable power generators AND mobile resource harvest buildings. America based.

[i]Zone based space travel[/i]

 Fleets use wormholes to travel  splitting all maps in to sectors enabling tactical attacks from multiple sides or really nasty choke points. 

You should REALLY read the story about why there are wormholes close to earth: http://foresightrts.com/wormhole-anomalies/

[b]Background story and progression[/b] 

[i]Background story itself  is good, but its presentation..[/i]

- You live on humanity's own mess up pile, they nuked their own planet, messed up space travel in worm hole experiments and fight against each other in the progress.

-  Read  background story before you play the game, more of the stuff makes sence then. Voice acting being one of them. 


[b]   MEH aspects.[/b]


[i]How the story is told. Is a huge potential meh [/i]

Some of the charecter commendaries are confusing and then there is voice acting. There are tons of negative comments about it and it can ""Sound"" atrocious.. least till you  bothered to read faction backstories from the web page.

- UCN is mostly asian based none of them have native english its just common language.
-Slavic Sirerians have intented slavic accent.
-NSAU , well they are english. If you want to hear english : check out NSAU

Voice acting actually was on most part design choise, also I heard from Jeremy that most of the voice actors were Volenteers, this is a small budget game after all.  (update : He changed pug's voice now ! )

[i] The Artificial intelligence [/i]

You really either hate or love this.

I got my ass kicked when I commanded everything myself. I had to learn to "" let go"" in mass fights and let the ai do its job.  It's not clever enough to start entire sector wide campaings with blizzard level of magnificience but its good enough be left to handle mass fights IF you do not order them too much.

I have seen ai do stuff like
- Cautious AI commander abandonts its fleet and runs. 
- Clever one focus fired enemy commanders down
- More ruthless one totally ignored defense positions and just blew generators to kingdom come.

Then again I also saw this : "" Requesting attack to sector x"" .. my OWN base was on that sector. 

[i]Music and sounds[/i]

 Mostly background style music on neutral level, not something you'd want to burn on your harddrive and listen as separate ( As example age of wonder's sound track),  don't expect that, and the music's and sounds are good.

[i]Graphical presentation[/i]

Apparently game was made by choise somewhat simplistic, to allow larger fleet fight. This means there is not much eye candy.

Nor eastern eggs, nor cards. Stuff like that is on works. 


[b]And now the ""why oh why""[/b]

[i] User interface[/i]

 I will first state that this is on rework apparently next patch.  Currently its complex.

- Makers made the keybindings based on their own localisation, this resulted some farts like: repair key being altgr + 8 for eu player .  

- Creating fleets and assigning advisors is clumsy.

- It's hard to remove units from fleets and to add them to other fleets.

-Fleet view at times doesn't view fleets but instead your main commanders face.

And small stuff like that.

[i] I want my skip button [/i]

While they already added options to skip things there is no way to skip in game cutschenes yet, and seeing them half dozen times on retries can be a pain.

You can't skip end and defeat score screen either.


[i] Steam ui hates this game [/i]

Standalone game works fine, but run it in steam you have issues like game crashing on alt tab.

[i] Multiplayer needs work [/i] 

 Multiplayer is somewhat complex and well, de syncing on large games.

[i] Simple design makes game bland[/i]

Not much to explore in this game, it focuses on execution and battles so the space is just full of small stars, not much debris asteroids or things like that.

[i] Polish in clarity needed [/i] 

Some things are hard to pick at, fleet locations, ally locations, you have to access minimap manually instead seeing it all the time but this is on works.

[i] Tutorial sucks[/i]

But can be skipped !



[b]Summary :[/b]


Foresight is a space game placed on era where humans have nuked earth and ruined space travel with wormhole experiements, telling story of Thomas Locke UNC commander who will see quite a bit duing the game.

Game is simple on the eye with decent sound score and good but optional backstory accessable from webside along with three fairly different factions and playstyles, that relies on semi ai controlled fleets  that can be used to fullest in zone based combat areas.


While having lot of potential, it currently suffers from few ui optimisation issues as well as background based voice acting.  

The game itself doesn't have fatal bugs.

As the game is now I'd give it 67/100 but it has potential to be  75-80 game and it will be, the dev's are very active, contact players and discuss their ideas openly.

Hours of content for a currently EA game and more is to come!

(From Test Build experience since this EA release is no different from the Test Build)

Imagine this, you're playing the tutorial levels and having a blast. You see you have equipment and is excited to use them. You see you have rope to use for ledges. Great! You use them! 

You don't see a counter for the ropes on the UI unlike the Drones and Explosives and assume they are infinite. Just like your grappling hook! Even more great! Now you can even reclimb the rope when you've finished exploring! 

So you explore the map more and more, killing freakish looking aliens until you reach the second character which has a different specialisation. Now you have 2 characters to play as. Cool! You then get to a point where you have to use the rope for the other character. ""No problem!"" you think, ""i'll just whip ou.....""

Wrong.

The ropes are gone. There were only a specific amount you couldn't see and now they're gone. The games asks you to use the rope to progress. But you can't. No ropes to pick up during the level apart from ammo. You are essentially softlocked. 30+ minutes gone. Now you have to replay the mission.

Its fun. Really fun. And this is just one of the issues this game currently has. There are mild irritations and annoyances with it which hopefully will be added and/or fixed. So wait before you buy this game until its further into development. Not currently worth the asking price of 19,99€.",1643082894,1705990099,True,0,0,0.6033464670181274,10,True,False,True,False,,1643120463.0,"Heyho,

Thanks for your feedback - Early Access luckily gives us the possibility to listen to this feedback and iron out the issues - like for example having not enough ""things"" when you need them - we are on it.

Though saying ""no different to the testbuild"" is just plain wrong - you should be easily able to tell that a lot of work has flown into the game since the testbuild, especially considering that we are talking about one single developer here.

I feel like this game could become really great and i will definitly continue playing.

However i feel like someone who isn't a fan or has not played any other AE games may find it difficult to get into this game.

Pros
- A lot of quests to be done
- Not Pay2Win from what i've seen
- Cross-Platform play

Cons
- The biggests con for me personally is camera controls, holding right mouse button to turn youre character and youre mouse gets stuck on the edge of the screen not allowing you to turn anymore (may just be for me idk)
- The grind  on this game is too much
- Difficulty of monsters feels too high
- UI is not the best

Some things i personally feel should be included
- Some sort of grouping/party system for free world and dungeons
- Being able to track more quests
- Bag sorting or different tabs for different things (eg materials, weapons and armor)
- Having a way to compare items
- Having some sort of equiped items screen to have a better feel for whats equiped
- Personally for me having played a lot of BattleOn and AQW, having more classes would be interesting (i know its early access and more classes are probably coming)
- Leveling up is nice but apart from general stats going up having a way to level up abilities or gain new or upgraded abilities would be cool

Remember these are my personal suggestions and may not appeal to everyone and i understand that.

As someone who has been playing this game since Early Access, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed with the final product. There are a lot of good things about it sure: the visual design is stunning; the music is great; and the story, while not the most sophisticated I've ever seen, is still interesting enough to keep you playing.

However, there are still plenty of things that don't seem to have been fixed at all since the EA stage and some things even got worse somehow. For starters, the game is still littered with bugs. NPCs will often pass through objects like ghosts (when they're not just falling through the floor). My favourite is when you're sitting on a bench, reading the paper, and an NPC just comes up and sits on top of you, trapping you on the bench until they decide to leave.

Second, a lot of the quests - side and main - are poorly designed. One quest had me sneak into [spoiler]an abandoned military base[/spoiler] in order to steal a key from one of the rooms. Problem was when I got there, the only way in was to pick the lock and I had no bobby pins left. I spent the next two hours creeping through the entire area looking for more pins but there were none to be found. Because this was a main mission, I couldn't even leave to go back to the Garden District for supplies.
Sadly, this sort of thing happens a lot although thankfully(?) it is usually only in the side-quests

My biggest gripe, though, is the gutting of the survival mechanics. In the original version, the game had your standard survival meters - hunger, thirst, sleep - and you had to keep them filled to ward off death. A later version gave you a mode that disabled them completely. The final version seems to have gone for a worst-of-both-worlds compromise: the meters still exist but instead of being a life-or-death feature, they simply offer you buffs if you keep them filled. The buffs themselves aren't all that usefull but at the same time, not having the buffs can make playthroughs just that much more annoying. IMO they should have just stuck to what they had before and make the survival meters optional.

There are a bunch of minor issues too. wonky AI, clunky combat mechanics, the constant jump in frame-rate, and so on. All in all, this game isn't ready for final release. I'm not saying I haven't enjoyed it so far and will definitely keep playing but that's only because I already had it. I wouldn't recommend buying it fresh in its current state. If it had been priced at an indie level - say US$20-30, then that would be one thing. However, it's got a AAA price tag so to release in such an unpolished state is... well actually, that's about as AAA as you can get these days. Still, the game is in desperate need of a few patches before it is worth the price it is asking for.",1534060574,1534060574,False,136,2,0.8753830194473265,0,True,False,False,False,,1540584073.0,"Hey, thank you for the feedback and for giving the game a try. 

The survival mechanics was something we struggled with a lot during development. We started with this vision of a hardcore roguelike survivor and once we launched on Early Access, players hated it with a passion. We had to rework it all in a small amount of time and resources. We understand and acknowledge it is not perfect. 

As for the glitches, we have released 4 patches since the game launched and are currently working on another one. Most of the issue you've mentioned have been fixed and further work is still being done to continue to polish the game.

More items, more weapons combination and more.

CBT REVIEW :

I do recommand this game, quite fun and easy to build the ""car"" of your dream. It's still EA so, at highter level you'll find yourself fighting against vet players who allready have everything unlocked, but still, even with low level parts you can win a game by yourself, it's all about strat and not being caught by the ennemy team at the wrong moment.

I do enjoyed my first 35h of building and fighting with my strange design.

Surprise your ennemy with a moving wall filled with medium turret is still the best thing i've done so far.

Looking to unlock futher components even is it's take ages to do so.

I was intrigued by the thumbnail so I went on the game's page for more information.

When I saw the preview trailer, I thought it seemed like a nice game so I told myself, why not give it a try. 

You spawn in what seems to be a prison cell, then, you fall asleep on the bed and the adventure begins. You appear in what seems to be a snowy valley between two mountains. Everything is filled with snow and the music complement the cold atmosphere. There, you meet your first enemy, a skeleton. 

Although the animations seem on point, the game lacks sound effects, because of that, the hits are silent and so are the enemies, so next thing you know, you're losing health so you turn around and there's a skeleton bashing you.

After a dozen of enemies in this frozen landscape, you reach a portal that brings you to a dungeon. There you appear with a torch and your stuff is lined on the walls next to you. The drone music aggremented with the poor visual field that the torch creates adds to the tension.

There are a few different paths you can take at that point but i'll stop my review here and skip to the goods and the bads of the game:

The goods:
- Absolutely fantastic atmosphere, the snowy mountains are wonderful and the dungeon creates a very stressful ambiance with a well-chosen set of colours.
- Wide array of items and weapons.
- Great music.
- Great animations.

The bads:
- Lack of sound effects (sword sounds, creatures sounds, etc).
- Issues with the interactions between the protagonist and the world (in the pillars room next to the spawn in the dungeon, it is very hard to reach the end of the pillars' parkour because the player keeps lagging on the pillars, also, the creatures are faster than the player and they have a hit advantage; you need to stand still to hurt them while they can hurt you while you move).
- Lack of description of the elements (ex: in the dungeon, you will sometimes meet stone gargoyles' head on walls blasting what seems to be glitter of different colours, you have no clue what it is so you reach to it to investigate and next thing you know, you're dead).
- Lack of a save system; you spawn back at the beginning of the map when you die and you lose all progress done during your last life.
- Once you quit the game, your game won't be saved locally, so next time you'll play, you'll start off from the very beginning.
- Lack of structure; you don't know where you need to go first and what to do. When I entered the dungeon, I told myself that I needed to complete the pillars' parkour first, so after close to 50 attempts, I managed to do so and next thing, I was flabergasted by three level 8 skeletons in the adjacent room with absolutely no chance of success (also there was this big red tree with these same gargoyles I mentionned earlier blasting red glitter, still not sure what they do).

- head gargoyles I removed. Previously, the red ray instantly killed, and the green healed.
- Improved the save system. Now saving occurs when you click on the statue in the city. I checked several times, the progress is saved after re-entering the game.

Sorry to hear you had a bad experience. Just to clarify, Elite Dangerous is an always-online multiplayer game rather than a single player one which is why an account is necessary.

It sounds like you took a wrong step somewhere - did you perhaps purchase from a third party? They have a tendency to sell game access without the correct instructions on how to redeem it. Alternatively your Windows installation may be missing some libraries necessary for the launcher to run.

If you're having some trouble uninstalling please do feel free to send us a support ticket and we can see what might be going on: https://support.frontier.co.uk/topic.php

After playing the main storyline through once (planning on doing it again the rebel way), here is my thoughts:

Spoilers ahead!

The game delivers really really well, and even exceeded my expectations in some parts. I enjoyed playing it to the point where I wasn't willing to stop playing. You guys at Crazy Rocks really did a very good job with this game! As with any game, there are pros and cons, so I'll list them here:

Pros:
- Actual stuff to do outside the border station, missions, transport prisoners and contrabands and missions. The map is also larger than I expected. 
- Upgradable border station.
- Get to actually interact with searching vehicles and actually putting in the effort to find inconsistencies in documents, smuggled items etc.
- The overall environment looks beautiful!
- Main storyline missions have variety. Sidequests are also fun to do.
- AI during Border Station attacks actually knows to take cover and use grenades, and just doesn't run up to us like headless chickens.
- Interaction with the vehicles! You get to even turn on and off the siren, load up stuff into the vehicle and such.
- I love when newcomers have a chance of just trying to escape from the station as well. We get to actually chase people.
- The game runs REALLY well as well.

As for the cons:
- The amount of ambushes feels a bit too much from time to time. I would get up to like 6 ambushes in one trip, delivering prisoners and contraband. Maybe have the amount tuned down, but make the ambushes more intense.
- I feel that the AI during ambushes and sidequests aren't bad, but I feel like it could be better. Sometimes, although not annoyingly large amount of times, they would rush you like headless chickens. Maybe have them take more cover and use more tactics and such.
- Cars sometimes feel like they are weak in terms of durability, and would start breaking apart and combust into flames quite quickly, specially after a small ambush. I would add some durability to them.
- Interacting with your police comrades and NPCs outside the border station is out of the question in this game, unfortunately. Unless it's during a mission which has dialogue.
- While the sidequests are interesting, there could have been a bit more variety and amount to them.
- There is no endless -mode. This would have been a good addition to the game as well.

Along with pros and cons I have some suggestions:

- I think there should be a chance for a smuggler to appear at the border, which doesn't have any of the smuggler marks, or appear on the board under the ""smugglers"" -note. Basically, they would be carrying some amount of the contraband inside the vehicle in hiding spots which don't have the mark (like under the seats, dashboard etc etc.), but is visible if paying attention. It would keep us on our toes and pay attention if we see anything inside, for example while unloading the cargo.
- During the war episode, I was expecting vehicles rigged with explosives to come to the border, which there were none. I would have added the chance for rigged vehicles to come to the border, and we would have to be careful with opening doors and such, otherwise the explosives would go off. And then have us go through a procedure of how to handle such situations, like having us make them safe to handle and such.
- Never during the game would I have been required to check under the vehicle themselves, which can be used as a hiding spot for contraband and such. Usually during vehicle inspections on checkpoints and such they would have mirrors on a stick which they could use to peek under the vehicle and see if there is anything there.

But overall, I love playing this game. It's super fun! Keep it up devs,

You can't adjust volumes or other settings in-game, just from the main menu.
When saving a game, it doesn't allow you to choose the name or file path of your saves. I don't like that lack of control. I want to know where on my system files are being put so that I can remove them if I so choose, and keep my drives clean.
As for the game-play:
Natural disasters are predetermined; a meteor strikes a critical building? Going back to a previous save point won't help you. It will just keep striking the same point over and over and over again. Getting the infrastructure going to get to the point where you can shoot down the meteors is much further into the game than when you actually need it.
The building required for getting your people inside when a sandstorm hits is also too deep into the game, as you get hit repeatedly with sandstorms almost from the start. Your starting bots and supply of spare parts will quickly get burned through.
Base personnel seem to be intent on doing everything except for the jobs that you need them to do, even when you prioritize a particular building. And, you can't prioritize a particular production component in a building, just the entire building. So, you really need bioplastic? Too bad, they'll just keep producing metal. Unless, you set up two different production buildings, which is too resource-intensive early-game. Besides, one or both will just get wiped-out by a meteor anyway.
You can't research new technologies; you have to buy them from traders who charge exorbitant commission rates. Even when one had a low trading skill (6), it was still a 40% commission. Not that I had anything of value to trade, because anything of value is too far into the game, and you need to trade to get it!

The only way to disable it would be with antivirus blocking start up.

Edit: at the request of friends I did a quick test to see how things are.

 The main reason I quit [mmo bs] was totally rolled back. In place of having to jump through hoops to have assess to all the tools in the sandbox you have to pay them more.

  The inventory full reminder is rather frequent. 

No default settings button so rather then uninstalling removing everything to get a totally fresh outlook I just uninstalled and won't be reinstalling any time soon.

 The tutorial tells you how to toggle camera before telling you how to get out of the cockpit and won't detect the toggle to progress the tutorial until you exit the cockpit. Had to go look at controls for a refresher.

 Momentum seems more broken then ever. Very slippery, like thrusters have less power when they're actuated as part of dampening. 

 I'm particularly offended that the DLC seem to just be remakes [if not straight rip offs] of other peoples mods that they are now charging money for...

I'm not sure when you last played but we've made huge sweeping improvements since your review in 2015. We released the game in an unfortunate state in April 2015 but never stopped updating it. With over 80 updates since then, 7 major updates containing tonnes of new features it's an entirely different game. We have added so much content that the install size has more than tripled to a still tidy 5GB! 

We'd love to know what you think of the game and the new stuff, here are some features we've added since release:

- Map Editor & Workshop Support with full scripting to create custom campaigns
- Overhauled Main Campaign
- Four Expansions with dozens of new features each. Two of these are completely free for you!
- New Game Modes
- Improvements across the board to the core game.
- Aesthetic Improvements
- Vastly improved framerate

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Cian

In this game, you crash if you touch the borders of the window and you are not side scrolling, but it's the same diff. Modern technology also allows you to pick up powerups and, as in Ricktofen, you gotta watch your fuel and ammo. Collect that ammo. Keep shooting things. I totally love this game and play it often.

While I agree that with Sparks of Transformation the process of unlocking new classes became more time-consuming, but please understand that in Skyforge this process is one of the major parts of gameplay, like leveling in some other MMOs. It is a challenge with a reward at the end of it.

Climb the ladder to godhood by quelling all threats that plague Aelion and its people.

/PROS/
Dear zeus the visuals are amazing.
By jupiter's beard are the classes fun to use.
Missions and sidequests will leave you busier than sisyphus.
Levels that give daedalus a run for his money.
Plenty of events with ample rewards behind them. Sadly can not earn a god pun as a reward.

/CONS/
Warframe levels of unfortunate mediocrity.
Very grind happy, especially the most reccent update. (red flag one)
Not entirely solo friendly so grab a buddy asap.
Went through the entire game feeling as if i was juuust below adequate sufficiency with weapons and abilities.
Delete the game and you delete your save, think twice!
On the cusp of being a vacant game dispite being free to play. (red flag two)

Not many fond memories with this game so im keeping the conslusion of reasonable length. Skyforge is the very definition of a gilded turd. This game will fish you in hook, line, and sinker with its enticing easy start and then sets up a pretty thick grindwall with the in-game store just in sight. I'm not knocking the devs for trying to make money i'm knocking them for making me play a repetitive content devoid game then asking for donations. Players will only buy microtransaction money if they feel the game has respected their time and gave a solid experience in return for their patience and effort, this game doesn't do that in the slightest nor has it shown signs of trying. Even after pouring real life money into this game you will almost never feel as if the purchase was justified as there will just be more grinding to do afterwards. The game is a low wage discount magician that has one trick and asks you for a donation after doing its sole performance twelve times consecutively with the promise of doing it twelve times more.

Destiny was a better MMO, and that game was a failure to itself and its playerbase.

Solid 5 out of 10.

It promises rogue-lite x boomer-shooter elements but it fails to deliver on both ends. The overall gameplay loop is also pretty annoying: complete ""nightmare"" or arena levels, play mini-games to level up, repeat. This dragged on for too long in a fast-paced shooter.

On the rogue-lite side, we get to carry over one level-1 weapon after each ""nightmare""; you can upgrade this in the skill tree. Each world consists of 3 levels, but these ""randomly generated"" levels felt boringly cloned with few differences. I would've preferred to play uniquely designed levels instead. There are also some events that occur based on RNG but it doesn't really make things more interesting. That's it. Did you notice that I didn't mention perma-death or difficulty options? Unfortunately, these don't exist in the game.

On the boomer-shooter side, it can actually be pretty fun and fast-paced. I enjoyed the weapon variety. The 2D horror art design and visuals are on point. The puzzles and backtracking elements are also pretty interesting, but they get super repetitive when you're playing the same level layout 3 times per world. If a difficulty option was available I think I would've really, really enjoyed this game: I was super disappointed when I melted the final boss.

All in all, Nightmare Reaper fails in its attempt to marry the rogue-lite and boomer-shooter genres together. The level design suffered heavily due to the ""rogue-lite"" elements. The mini-games interrupted the fast-paced shooting gameplay. And the lack of difficulty options is a BIG negative for both shooter and rogue-lite genre fans alike.",1683111784,1683111784,False,0,0,0.0,0,False,False,False,True,,1683120020.0,We're sorry you didn't enjoy the game.

The writing was very well done, and while the puzzles were a mix of extremely satisfying and occasionally head-scratching, the worldbuilding and memorable characters more than made up for its shortcomings. 

I did appreciate being able to 'incorrectly' solve certain puzzle chains, and that the game tries to tell you that you've done something wrong. One such instance led to me reloading an earlier save and doing the whole sequence again, which ended up being an *extremely* good decision. 

If the game had one major flaw, it would be that its climax felt a little rushed and underwhelming [spoiler] (the underground section in particular, it felt a little strange to have control taken away from your character in such a pivotal moment, and it was too short for the return afterwards to feel meaningful) [/spoiler] but other than that, the story was very good and the underlying mystery kept me invested the whole time.

Also, bonus points for including a character that talks only in rhyme. I don't know why, but something about that trope gets me every time.

It's not because it's a bad game, it just doesn't feel finished at all.
I think the dev has came a long way to making a really nice game and I truly hope they continue to work on it, but it's just not finished at this time.

1. The animal respawns and AI are not yet completed.  I see eagles frozen in mid air, waiting for the player to walk near them.

2. There are keys you cannot rebind. When consulting the developer, they said the key was bound in game.  Sorry, game building 101 says never, ever hard code a key.

3. Building mechanics have issues.  You build a foundation, a few walls, then the game refuses to build a ceiling (no roof pieces yet). So to build the ceiling, you must destroy the walls, and sometimes the foundation then rebuild the structure and maybe, just maybe it will let you add the ceiling.

4. Placing a non snapping item on the ground like a planter is not a good experience. It's because of the character animation. When swapping to first person character, please turn off the idle animation so the player doesn't feel drunk when trying to place a part.

Food and drink are good.
Animal attacks are good.

What this is however is more like a FPS which you're supposed to enjoy with friends. Exploration is minimal and the enemies are predictable and come in waves. Levelling up and powering up is also trivial.

What sets it apart from the simpler hex-based strategy games it resembles is a well-realized supply system. Friendly and enemy supply enters the map at set places, runs freely along rail lines, and can be extended by creating supply depots. Disrupting enemy supply while protecting your own is a core part of the game.

What impresses me about this system is that despite being simple and abstractified, it organically drives you toward realistic tactics. In most non-spreadsheety strategy games I've played, a lot of the maneuver I'm thinking about is kiting enemy attack ranges, protecting ranged units with direct combat ones, that kind of thing. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but in this game I'm thinking about breakthroughs and encirclements, shoring up my flanks, and counting how many hexes forward I can go without outrunning my supply. It's impressively [i]realistic[/i] for how simple it is. 

Well, I don't want to oversell how simple it is. There's definitely a learning curve and you'll definitely have to refer to the manual, but there are no spreadsheets here; everything is there for you on the map itself.

The scenario design is solid. They're well-grounded in real history, and provide a stiff challenge, mainly by asking you to keep a strict timetable. You have the initiative, which in practical terms means you have the superior force and are thus able to force the issue, but what makes it hard is taking objectives on time without suffering unnecessary losses that will make you weaker in future scenarios. On classic difficulty you'll face some pretty wrenching dilemmas. On normal difficulty you get one extra turn on everything, which really takes the edge off and makes flawless victory consistently achievable with proper play.

The AI is seldom irrational, and is good at punishing mistakes. If you leave a division in a vulnerable position, it will destroy it. If you leave an exploitable gap in your lines, it will drive a mobile division through and overrun a supply depot or cut off your vanguard forces. If you cross your ""t""s and dot your ""i""s, it will pretty much just stay in its fortified positions and hang on as long as possible. The game supports hotseat multiplayer, but it doesn't seem to me that the enemy side would be fun to play in almost any scenario. You'd hardly be able to DO anything that doesn't just make you lose harder, unless the other guy screws up.

My only real complaint against the game is that it kinda ruined Panzer General style games for me. They just feel too gamey and unrealistic now, its unsatisfying. I never had this problem before. The UoC2 devs better keep releasing expansion campaigns if they want to make it up to me!",1575528851,1662451534,True,1,0,0.5185185670852661,0,True,False,False,True,,,,809230

Sorry to hear you didn't enjoy it. I'm not sure how accurate Steam's time reporting is, but you should hopefully find the platforming and puzzles become more involved past the opening sections. We keep things light early on to ease people in.

Hopefully you can find time to go back to it and dig a little further in :)

I have learned over the years that simplicity and ease of play typically triumph over details, details, and more details.  Now, don't get me wrong--deep dive simulations can be very enjoyable.  It is easy, however, to lose yourself in the thicket while the world passes you by.  

This game is easy to pick up and easy to play.  There are no supply rules to worry about.  There are no cohesion points to finagle.  In short, this is wargaming at its most primitive.  And...for some odd reason, it works!  Perhaps it's the ferocius AI or maybe it's the simplicity.  Regardless, as the German player you feel the desperation as the Soviet hordes slowly grind you into dust.  They maneuver smartly, they attack smartly...as I said, ferocious AI.

Now, this game does have its problems.  The manual is basically non-existent.  You have to figure a lot of things out on your own.  Stick with it though, and you'll soon be telling your wife ""just one more turn"" as you watch your units slowly get strangled by the Russian juggernaut.  Highly recommended--fun game that captures the spirit of the desperate Korsun defense quite well.",1540765263,1540765263,True,75,0,0.8692705035209655,0,True,False,False,False,,1540770884.0,"Hi alejes02

Thanks for your comments. I realize now that I seriously underestimated how much detail to put in the Manual. Lesson Learnt. I am gradually updating as I get feedback.
